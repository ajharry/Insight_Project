sponView: a web application for identifying sponsored content in youtube videos.


See www.sponview.site for the finished project!

sponView is a web app with convienient Chrome extension that allows you to quickly determine whether the youtube video that you are watching contains paid promotion, based only on the captions in the video. I created sponView for my project as an Insight Data Science Fellow.
