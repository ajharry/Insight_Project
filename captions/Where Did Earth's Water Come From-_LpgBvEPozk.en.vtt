00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.190
 Unlike all the other planets in our solar system 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.500
 It covers water in its liquid state 70% of the land area 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 Which despite being a useful life, it is still strange existence. 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.150
 Because everything we know about how the time of formation of our planet 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 Requires that the surface of the Earth Java. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.010
 The story begins this way: 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.250
 Be our solar system from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.580
 The thick liquid gas flared is located in the middle and formed the sun 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.400
 When she was a modern and stable star strong solar wind fired. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.860
 Over time, this current component of the charged particles led to the payment of the remaining gas cloud away, 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.040
 Leaving only solid particles that banded together Kckor then planetesimals 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 Finally rocky planets within the solar system known to us today. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.260
 Here is the problem; 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.100
 It is that the water in its solid state Kjlad can not be one of those remaining solid particles that formed our planet 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.720
 Because the solar system at the beginning it was very warm and not allow the existence of frozen water, 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.900
 And any water vapor was paid by the solar wind outside. 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.980
 So, if the ground at the beginning did not contain water, 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.855
 So how wonderful the oceans formed? 

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.175
 We know that the compound H2O (water) is not configured inside the earth through the ages 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.280
 Because natural processes such as photosynthesis, respiration burning and construction 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.940
 Working on the creation and extinction of a similar amount of water almost. 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.840
 In any case, the quantities we are talking about little 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080
 To the extent that they do not explain the presence of huge amounts of water on the planet. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.260
 As the ground water has not made up with them and did not make it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.000
 That means they entered the Earth from a distant place 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.760
 Through meteorites or comets or other objects formed outside the solar system that 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.000
 Where it was far from the sun enough to allow the presence of frozen water. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 Snow balls are considered muddy any comets 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 One candidate Almacolan as a source of water on the ground 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.760
 But we exclude this possibility when we discovered it is rich in heavy hydrogen 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.930
 Located on the ground compared with water. 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380
 Heavy hydrogen from proton and neutron in its nucleus consists. 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.780
 Every million hydrogen atom in the ground water, 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.680
 There are about 150 heavy hydrogen atom 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.360
 While the water in the comet contain twice that number. 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.040
 This contradiction in the chemical properties indicates that the ground water did not arise from the arrival of comets 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.470
 It turned out that the most likely source of the waters of the Earth 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.270
 Is a type of meteorite called "carbon Alkondric". 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 "Alkondric" is just a name for a class of stony meteorites that hit the earth in abundance. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.240
 But only "carbon Alkondric" is that contains water 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.460
 Along with a large amount of carbon as indicated by its name. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.940
 They contain water because it was formed behind the "frost line" the sun, 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.190
 Indeed, the water on it with levels of heavy hydrogen similar to the ground water. 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.520
 So it is very likely that these things crashing to the ground 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.820
 It is the source of ice caps, clouds, rivers and oceans. 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.780
 Therefore, this water that turned the planet into a blue crystal came literally 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.580
 Accidentally.
