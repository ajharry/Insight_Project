Some of you asked me in the past if I have any original characters, and if I could draw them

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.220
A long time ago, I came up with a guy called Finn

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.080
But I never did much with the character design, other than a few drawings here and there

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.360
I still like his basic design, but I felt like a new person was needed

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.420
And so recently I brought another character to paper, who I called Ian Manning.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.275
Around the same time, I've benn contacted by Amino about their platform OC Amino

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.980
I've seen some of you talk about Art Amino in the comments of my videos already,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.180
and so we thought OC Amino could also be of interest to you

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.560
Them sponsoring this video is also an opportunity for me to share my character Ian with you

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.980
OC Amino is all about sharing you original characters, your OCs

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.980
You can post pictures of them, tell their backstory or show others

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.095
how you came up with the design, or how it changed over time

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.620
All the while you get to know other artists and their OCs, so you can tell stories together

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.620
With polls you can get input on your designs, techniques and other decisions by other artists and friends you've made in the app

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.935
and get them involved in the world of your OC

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:07.815
Another reason feature are shared folders

00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:11.115
in which you can upload images and art posts and organize them by album

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.180
You can also look forward to audio and video chat very soon I've been told

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.820
You can find the link to the app in the video description

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820
Give it a try and share your OCs

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.275
Now about Ian, whom I've been sketching here

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:25.805
First of all, for me it's really hard to stick to OCs

00:01:25.805 --> 00:01:29.780
Since I have trouble with thinking of backstories when working on my own characters

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.500
Not that OCs necessarily need to have one,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
but I think that would've helped me to keep drawing them more often

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.660
So far I've only come up with about three characters over the years that I have been drawing

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.880
Of course I wasn't only working on fanarts or other artist's OCs

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.820
But when scribbling random characters I often felt that it wasn't enough to call that character my OC

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.280
Because it was boring and I knew, I probably wouldn't draw him or her again

00:01:55.825 --> 00:01:58.025
When trying to work actively on a design,

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.825
with me it often starts with a basic idea, like

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:03.775
a haircut, or some clothes for example

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.320
which made me wonder what kind of person would fit to that

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.520
So I end up having some rough character traits and a bit of the general look

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.560
which is a good start, but in my case it often ends there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000
since writing stories and dialogues is really something I have to work on

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.580
It often feels too cliche or too unoriginal when I write some pieces of text

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.400
that I won't even continue writing

00:02:24.405 --> 00:02:27.085
I really want to get rid of that attitude, because

00:02:27.085 --> 00:02:30.135
how am I supposed to get better if I don not practice?

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:32.855
It's the same with drawing actually

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.020
Needless to say that with Ian i'm also not that sure where it will go currently

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.820
But I'm excited to draw him more often

00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:41.465
The name Ian was suggested on Instagram by the way

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:43.665
so thank you everyone who gave some input

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:46.915
The last name Manning comes from

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:49.505
an Orphan Black character called Sarah Manning who is also

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:51.300
a very tough and fun person

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.575
The haircut was inspired by my older character Finn

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.865
which was from the young Dante from Devil May Cry

00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:01.660
I like to think of him as being part of some kind of badass exorcist story

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.800
but he could also be the antagonist dude in some other sport anime

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:08.485
Or some character in a high school romance

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:10.915
But maybe you have some creative thoughts on this

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:14.265
Let me know in the comments below where I could where I could take him storywise

00:03:17.725 --> 00:03:18.725
