00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.900
Sup, everyone, I'm your female otaku.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.840
A YouTuber who isn't affiliated nor sponsoring CrunchyRoll

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.800
However

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240
There has been a huge argument in the community

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.440
About watching anime legally

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.460
And I think a lot of people are missing the point of the situation.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.640
You see the main reason to why the popular anime YouTubers

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.220
Constantly tell you to stream anime legally

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.360
Is to "Support the Industry."

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.360
But lets be honest here

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.740
How many of you go to a legal streaming site to "Support the industry?"

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.160
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040
All though this is a nice way to go about the situation

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.080
This just not a natural was of thinking

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.380
That is like saying "Oh hey, lets go to McDonalds instead of making our food for free to support the industry!"

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.720
That's just not how people think

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.620
And that's okay

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.280
Now this video isn't going to be about me bashing illegal websites, and those use use them.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.720
Quite the opposite actually

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.420
Instead, I'm going to tell you a story as to why I got a CrunchyRoll account in the first place

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.540
It was the 2015 spring season

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.740
The season that aired 'Danmachi,' 'Food Wars,' 'High School DxD' and 'Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches.'

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.060
Yes this was a very eechi season

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.920
I was highly anticipating the premiere episode of Yamada-kun

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.780
Because I watched and loved the liver action adaptation 6 months prior

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.080
At that time, I used several illegal websites

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.015
Some being faster than others

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.725
When the day finally came for Yamada-kun to premiere

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.480
I kept waiting, and waiting for one of the seven illegals websites sites I used to have it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.020
The first episode aired, and I waited another hour. It still wasn't up on any of those sites, which was odd

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.920
Not even the faster ones had it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.815
Then I waited two more hours, three more hours,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.080
And finally four. After four hours, I couldn't wait anymore.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.160
I went on CrunchyRoll

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.060
And made an account starting with the fourteen day free trial

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.900
My plan was to delete the account once the trial had ended

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.895
But I was surprised to see Yamada-kun in 1080p

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.440
Because no illegal website I used went higher than 720p

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.220
I was also shocked to see that they had news articles to update you on otaku related content

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.680
Including anime announcements and J-Pop music videos

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.420
They even have a store where all premium members get a discount on every single item

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.240
Be it a $2 discount, or a $30 discount

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.900
Needless to say, I was very pleased with the service and no matter how fast an illegal website is, it just can't beat CrunchyRoll

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.800
So I kept my account

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.480
I used to upload anime reviews within the hour when the episode aired

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.280
And people would ask me "Hey Sloan, it's not on *insert illegal website here* yet!"

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.900
And I always point them to CrunchyRoll

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.540
Now, what's the real reason why hardcore anime fans and otakus stream anime legally?

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.800
It's to watch

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.820
Anime.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.920
No one goes and makes a Netflix account thinking about the industry

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.620
We just want to watch our shows and movies in the highest of quality

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.600
In my case, I want all of that, plus being one of the first people to watch a new episode right when it aires.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.960
Sure CrunchyRoll may have a delay here and there, but if CrunchyRoll has a delay

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.880
So do the illegal websites

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.860
And compared to all the times they gave us high quality anime on time

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.700
I say it's worth your $5

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.280
If for whatever reason you can't afford all the legal streaming sites or maybe it's not available in your county

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.300
I understand

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.580
This is just me simply telling you why I use legal anime streaming sites

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.000
And if you are considering at least stream legally for only one website

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520
Then it should be CrunchyRoll

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.260
Once again, this video is not sponsored, but I will put a link to CrunchyRoll's homepage in the description

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.460
I'm your female otaku, sayonara
