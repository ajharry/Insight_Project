Sword Art Online: The Beginning
Sponsored by IBM
 - Future Possibilities Brought about by Technology -

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.700
[Yuriko Furunaga, Director, Cloud Marketing, IBM Japan]
Right now in 2016, we are entering the future.

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:11.099
This is what we feel.

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.300
Under such circumstances, what types of changes can technology bring to your business?

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:20.100
How can our latest technologies at IBM make creative contributions?

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.100
We are always looking for opportunities to answer these questions.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.300
[Yukiko Yamaguchi, Manager, Communications &amp; Brand Experience, Marketing &amp; Communications, IBM Japan]
Experience the possibilities technology can bring to the future.

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.500
The story that we selected to make that happen is Sword Art Online,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.800
which is a fictional virtual reality game to be released in 2022.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.800
How can we use the latest technologies we have today to express the world of Sword Art Online?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.070
It is a challenge that no one has experienced before.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.120
It is a challenge that no one has experienced before.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:05.400
[Reki Kawahara, Author of Sword Art Online]
I felt strongly that it was possible the story I dreamed up about 15 years ago could eventually come true.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.900
This project, from the time of its release, garnered a lot of media attention, as well as a tremendous response on social media.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.120
This project, from the time of its release, garnered a lot of media attention, as well as a tremendous response on social media.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.300
This turned our expectations for the project into conviction.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.400
[Tomoari Yasuda, Senior Architect and IBM Cloud Evangelist, IBM Cloud Japan]
To make this happen, we had to exchange a large volume of data, such as 3D scanning data and sensing data, on our network.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:35.100
We knew a technology that we have, SoftLayer, would give the best performance for this project.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.100
Alpha test released on March 18, 2016

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.100
The player’s body is 3D-scanned and instantly turned into an avatar

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.300
The player is taken as-is into the world of Sword Art Online

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.500
Walk around in a virtual reality world...

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.040
...and meet friends.

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.589
Sensations that could not be felt on a screen are now much better and can actually be felt.

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:34.500
Things like the original story’s interface are replicated quite well.

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:39.600
I feel strongly that our future experiences will be like this.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.900
It felt like the future itself.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.000
You think, “I want to be in this kind of world” when reading Sword Art Online. It just got a bit closer to that world.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:01.300
I feel that we at IBM can show you how our latest technologies can make creative contributions and bring innovations to our lives.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.580
Technology blazes a trail to the future.
