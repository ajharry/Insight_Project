00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.149
So many of you have been asking for a garden tour. here and while it's kinda hard

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.289
And while it's kinda hard to really show you the breadth and depth of my garden,

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.320
I'm gonna show you a few key highlights of what I call my kitchen garden.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.679
This is the one that I use for all my different creations in the kitchen.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.859
It's not necessarily what I always use for all my canning,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.160
but it is one I use in everyday life and I'm so excited to share it with you.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.300
As you know, I love gadgets and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.300
garden gadgets - although I'm always a little skeptical, I always think they're worth a try

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.280
and the new Edyn Garden Sensor seriously is awesome.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.560
Whether you're a beginner gardener

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.240
or you are a very experienced gardener, this tool is so great to have.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.560
You just put it right into the soil and this tells you the nutrition of your soil,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.420
the humidity in the air, the light your plants are getting and the moisture.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.420
What is so great about the Edyn Garden Sensor is that it syncs right to the Edyn app on your phone

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.080
and it uploads all the information right to your phone so whenever you want,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.800
you can just just pick up your phone and look at how your garden is doing.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.200
I can look and see if things are getting enough water, if they're getting enough light,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.080
too much light or even too much water.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.920
It is so awesome to have.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.580
What is also so cool is you can put in all the plants that you plant in your garden,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.160
and you can track and it will tell you what is great for each one of those plants

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.300
and what's working and what isn't.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.720
I grow an assortment of herbs.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.200
And I really have no rhyme or reason for what I do, but I just like to try different ones

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.360
and every year I seem to add some and have my staples I always stick with.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.920
I always grow two types of parsley - flat leaf and curly.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.520
They have a slightly different flavor and just are used in different ways so it's great to grow both.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.820
I of course also always grow thyme and oregano.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.720
They are so good in homemade pizza sauces or pasta sauces

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.470
and they're just such great classic ones to grow.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.380
And of course I love basil. Not only for homemade pesto, which is one of my favorite things,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.740
but if you just want a fresh salad with some fresh tomatoes, there is nothing like fresh basil.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.860
I'm using the word fresh a lot, but it's worth it because it's the garden.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.160
And stay tuned because I'm gonna be doing a ton of videos using these herbs this summer

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.740
and especially a basil pesto because it's classic and I love it.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.960
And I do grow different types of basil

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.880
more just for the novelty, not because it's so important

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.800
but I just love to try them out: purple basil,
Thai basil, mammoth basil, regular basil.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.680
It's all worth a try, right?

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.510
My turnips are doing really well.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.230
I'm picking some, but I'm also making sure to thin them out.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.590
When you plant turnip seed, it's so small that you can't really plant it like one every inch or two,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.450
it's just too little and I kinda just throw a whole bunch into the trough.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.720
But then when it comes up, they're way too close together to really grow well.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.700
So I always go through and weed out the ones that aren't doing well to give the other ones more

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.380
ample space so they grow into larger turnips.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860
Then when they are ready, I am able just to pull these beautiful turnips from the ground,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.880
cut off the tops and the root and enjoy a fresh turnip.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.019
I know some of you are thinking: seriously how old are you that you love turnips?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.540
I'm not that old, but I just love the fresh flavors of these vegetables

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.940
and I think if you try them out, you will too.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.140
I also love growing broccoli and
cauliflower it's one of my favorite

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.410
things you get these beautiful had the
broccoli and I know a lot of people

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.920
think

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.200
according to all that brought me a once
I eat it

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.490
you can roasted fact a it eating brash

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.090
in did you know it brought me once you
get that first had don't wanna plants

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.220
one time I don't know that number my mom
was like Caleb leave the plan to keep

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.620
producing little broccoli

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.050
and it does all throughout the season
just cut that one had

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.540
leave the plant annual he leaves little
rocky flats

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.510
all throughout the growing of Arctic the
little bit more work

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.150
if you don't I have your call flowering
plants in the sign in turn yellow and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.010
and yes you can buy ones that are wealth
of plan she meaning the leaders just

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.330
curl up on themselves but I found it
really doesn't work that well so I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.170
always tired all type of flower

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.730
when you see you get a small head in the
center just tying up

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.580

just throw a little bit and a certain

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.840

ways you can do in

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.139

I promise you they taste better than
what you buy in a grocery store

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.550
once you have some this home produce
grow in you're gonna wonder how you

ever got by on that bought stuff I now

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.969
a la party year you have to get by on
the bonds up I do it to you by

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.949
if you can try the home tomatoes are
pretty easy to grow

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.000
a really just take care of themselves
that they have good water and sunlight

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.400
I do you make sure to nap of those
little suckers I don't think suckers a

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400
technical term

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.719
but it's just what I call the little
growth that come out on top with some

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:00.499
believe it's

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.620
this gives the plant more chance to get
more air and sunlight all the places

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.990
and so it doesn't get near speci an
overgrown otherwise use gonna have a

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.659
