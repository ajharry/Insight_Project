00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:07.886
- Good afternoon.

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:10.946
I'm Daniel Benjamin and I'm
delighted to welcome you

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:13.223
to this event of the
John Sloan Dickey Center

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:16.139
for International Understanding.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.015
Our guest today is one of
the most compelling figures

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:21.817
of the last decades of the 20th century

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:24.650
and the first decades of the 21st.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.579
She is rightly known as
one of our most outstanding

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.603
Secretaries of State,
as well I should add,

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.688
as being the first woman
to hold that office.

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:37.902
Whether in or out of office,

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:40.953
she has also been one of
the nation's most tireless,

00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:43.986
dedicated, and effective public citizens,

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:47.535
a tough and relentless
advocate for American values

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:49.241
and American interests.

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:52.411
She has been a beacon for
democracy and human rights

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.619
around the world and a
clear voice of conscience

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.774
in some of the most difficult
international situations

00:00:58.774 --> 00:00:59.941
we have faced.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.283
Madeleine Korbel Albright is
a native of Czechoslovakia

00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:08.610
and yet her story is profoundly American.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.359
As a child, she was twice a refugee,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.059
first from Hitler, in
his concentration camps,

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:16.717
three of her grandparents perished,

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:20.563
and then from Stalin when
the Iron Curtain fell.

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:24.268
The daughter of a distinguished
Czechoslovakian diplomat

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:25.997
and an international affairs scholar,

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:30.678
her early years saw her move
from a fine embassy residence

00:01:30.678 --> 00:01:33.511
to a small rented house in Denver.

00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:39.613
Dr. Albright received a Bachelors
with honors from Wellesley

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:42.577
and, as lots of college
students from excellent schools

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:45.290
find out every year,
she learned how to start

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.080
from the bottom.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.090
Her first jobs were as a cub reporter

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.221
for the Rolla Missouri Daily
News writing obituaries,

00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.024
articles for the society pages,

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.658
and as she notes in her autobiography,

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.075
interviewing people who had spotted UFOs.

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:05.600
Later, she worked picking pictures

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.694
for Encyclopedia Britannica.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:10.712
Eventually, she returned
to graduate school,

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:13.832
earning a masters and a doctorate degree

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:17.553
from Columbia from the
Department of Law and Government,

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:20.705
and she settled into
raising three daughters

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:23.628
and a vigorous life of volunteer work.

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:27.374
At the age of 39, 15
years after her last job

00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:29.835
at the Britannica, she was hired

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:34.002
as Chief Legislative Assistant
to US Senator, Edmund Muskie

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:36.978
and the beginning of
her extraordinary career

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:38.978
in public affairs began.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.156
Within just a short time,

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:43.526
she was the head of Legislative Affairs

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:47.668
for President Jimmy Carter's
National Security Council.

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.944
Later, she was Foreign Policy Advisor

00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:52.866
to 1984 Vice Presidential
Democratic Candidate,

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:56.514
Geraldine Ferraro, and the
1988 Presidential Candidate,

00:02:56.514 --> 00:02:57.847
Michael Dukakis.

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.329
She was President of the
Center for National Policy

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.319
and after the 1992
election of Bill Clinton,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.276
was confirmed as permanent representative

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:10.735
to the United Nations.

00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:14.449
In 1997, she was
confirmed by the US Senate

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:17.079
as the 64th Secretary of State,

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.878
ascending to a post held
by Thomas Jefferson,

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:23.221
John Quincy Adams, a
certain Dartmouth graduate

00:03:23.221 --> 00:03:27.388
named Daniel Webster, George
Marshall, and Dean Acheson.

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:30.744
There are no easy times
to be Secretary of State,

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:33.826
but Secretary Albright's
tenure was notably challenging.

00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:36.633
She faced conflicts in
the Balkans in Iraq,

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.029
terrorist bombings in Africa,

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.203
a balky Middle East peace process,

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:45.391
and the work of shaping
post Cold War Europe.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.227
Challenges remain in many of those areas,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.366
but it is a testament to
Secretary Albright's achievements

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.376
that those years now
look relatively halcyon

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:56.528
compared to some of the
problems we face today.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.451
In the inbox she left her successor

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:02.341
was but a fraction of what
was left eight years later

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:05.026
to Secretary Hilary Clinton.

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:07.197
It's worth noting as well
that Secretary Albright

00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:09.047
was one of the very few secretaries,

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:11.666
perhaps the only one, who
was offered a promotion

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.899
when she left office, but
she declined her friend,

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.721
Vaclav Havel's kind offer to help make her

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:20.709
President of the Czech Republic

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.709
and resume private life in Washington.

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:26.774
Since leaving office,
Secretary Albright seems,

00:04:26.774 --> 00:04:29.914
if anything, and if it
is physically possible,

00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:31.799
to have accelerated.

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:34.873
She is now chair of the
Albright Stonebridge Group,

00:04:34.873 --> 00:04:37.013
one of the world's foremost international

00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:38.685
strategic consulting firms,

00:04:38.685 --> 00:04:40.892
and professor in the practice of diplomacy

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:44.369
at the Georgetown University
School of Foreign Service.

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.209
She chairs both the National
Democratic Institute

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.235
for International Affairs

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:51.732
and the Pew Global Attitudes Project,

00:04:51.732 --> 00:04:53.244
and serves as president

00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:56.309
of the Truman Scholarship Foundation.

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.501
In nine years, she has written five

00:04:58.501 --> 00:05:00.851
New York Times' bestsellers,

00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:05.309
enough to bring envy to
the most prolific of us.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.770
These include Madame
Secretary, a memoir from 2003,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.251
Memo to the President,

00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:13.581
How We Can Restore America's Reputation

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.403
and Leadership from 2008,

00:05:15.403 --> 00:05:17.614
and most recently, Prague Winter,

00:05:17.614 --> 00:05:19.638
A Personal Story of Remembrance and War,

00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:22.555
1937-1948, which published in 2012.

00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:28.009
In that same year, 2012,

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.502
Secretary Albright received

00:05:29.502 --> 00:05:30.954
the Presidential Medal of Freedom,

00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:33.404
the nation's highest civilian honor,

00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:35.154
from President Obama.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.207
When she is not on a plane or at a podium,

00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:41.188
she is doing something in some
ways even more remarkable,

00:05:41.188 --> 00:05:43.696
supporting and developing the
community of foreign policy

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:47.189
practitioners in Washington
and around the country.

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.861
Everyone knows well Harry Truman's quip

00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.975
that if you want a friend
in Washington, buy a dog,

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:55.714
but as someone who has
benefited immeasurably

00:05:55.714 --> 00:05:57.812
from her wisdom and her friendship,

00:05:57.812 --> 00:05:59.570
I can say that President Truman

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.754
never knew Secretary Albright,
who's been an advisor

00:06:02.754 --> 00:06:04.917
and a friend for me and many others

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:07.622
who have served in or around
government in recent years.

00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:11.357
Her presence here is a testament
to that kind of friendship.

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:14.597
Believe me, this sort of
generosity with time and support

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:17.449
is not the norm out there,
and there is a generation

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.007
of us who are profoundly
grateful to Madeleine Albright

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:22.873
for her leadership and
especially for her friendship.

00:06:22.873 --> 00:06:25.021
It is now a great
pleasure for me to welcome

00:06:25.021 --> 00:06:27.235
Secretary Madeleine Albright.

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:29.485
(applause)

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.702
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:06:48.702 --> 00:06:49.535
Thank you.

00:06:52.062 --> 00:06:52.895
Thank you.

00:06:55.143 --> 00:06:56.411
Well Mr. Benjamin,

00:06:56.411 --> 00:07:00.251
I would like to thank you for
telling everybody who I am

00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:03.320
because not everybody always knows.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.121
Not long ago, I was
coming back from China.

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:08.243
Chicago was the first port of entry.

00:07:08.243 --> 00:07:11.391
I was there getting undressed
for the security people.

00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.366
I put my stuff down on the conveyor belt

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.404
and the lady behind me said,

00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:17.371
"So where'd you get all
those screw top bottles?

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:19.082
"My bottles all leak."

00:07:19.082 --> 00:07:20.689
I said, "I got 'em at
the Container Store."

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:23.046
Then I was going through the magnetometer

00:07:23.046 --> 00:07:25.008
and the TSA guard looked
at me and he said,

00:07:25.008 --> 00:07:26.841
"Oh my God, it's you."

00:07:28.407 --> 00:07:29.856
He said, "I'm from Bosnia.

00:07:29.856 --> 00:07:31.732
"We all love you in Bosnia
and if weren't for you,

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:33.066
"there wouldn't be a Bosnia.

00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:35.345
"You're welcome to come to Bosnia."

00:07:35.345 --> 00:07:37.267
Then he said, "Can I have
my picture taken with you?"

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:40.026
So we stopped the whole
line, it's a complete mess.

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:41.408
I go back to get my stuff

00:07:41.408 --> 00:07:43.452
and the lady of the
screw top bottles said,

00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:45.503
"So what exactly happened here?"

00:07:45.503 --> 00:07:47.875
I said, "Well, I used to
be Secretary of State."

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.991
She said, "Of Bosnia?"

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.324
(laughter)

00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.376
So thank you for straightening that out.

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.959
- I'm glad I could.

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:03.086
I'm also glad you were a
Secretary of State here.

00:08:03.086 --> 00:08:06.086
So you are notably adorned in green.

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:10.695
- Totally.

00:08:12.109 --> 00:08:14.359
(applause)

00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:19.894
- In the sense of connections
and not of neckwear,

00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:22.561
you have lots of Dartmouth ties.

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:26.934
Perhaps you'd like to review those.

00:08:26.934 --> 00:08:28.176
- I would.

00:08:28.176 --> 00:08:31.558
I'm delighted and I have to
say I'm a Dartmouth mother.

00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:34.736
My daughter is the class of 1983.

00:08:34.736 --> 00:08:37.536
She was the goalie of the ice hockey team,

00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:41.039
she has many varsity
letters from Dartmouth,

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.122
and she was a very proud alum.

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:48.479
She also was part of the
Tucker Program Foundation,

00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:50.978
which is what directed her to the law.

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.119
She is now a judge.

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:56.123
I was also asked to give the
commencement speech here.

00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:58.501
I have come up a number of times,

00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.971
notably sometimes during
the New Hampshire primaries.

00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:03.717
I have been back and forth.

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:05.866
It's a fabulous school and I'm delighted

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:07.639
that you asked me to come.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.692
- Well, we're delighted
to have you here too.

00:09:09.692 --> 00:09:12.655
Judging by that reception,
I'd say you're something

00:09:12.655 --> 00:09:15.572
of a rock star in the upper valley.

00:09:17.482 --> 00:09:19.972
If only we could continue talking
about such pleasant things

00:09:19.972 --> 00:09:24.139
as the college, but we meet
at a rather vexing moment,

00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:28.843
I'd say, in international affairs.

00:09:28.843 --> 00:09:30.385
We probably should plunge right in

00:09:30.385 --> 00:09:32.187
because you've been
talking about this a lot

00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:33.354
in the public.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.540
I think you've used the word
"game changer" to describe

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.512
what has happened in the Crimea,

00:09:41.512 --> 00:09:43.593
and Russia's intervention there,

00:09:43.593 --> 00:09:48.460
and the continued perilous
state of affairs in Ukraine.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.911
I was wondering if you
wanted to give us your view

00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:54.552
of that situation, its lasting impact,

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.809
and what we ought to be doing about it.

00:09:56.809 --> 00:10:00.279
- I think it is a truly serious situation

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.372
and a game changer in the following way.

00:10:02.372 --> 00:10:04.917
If I could just take a
few moments to answer it,

00:10:04.917 --> 00:10:08.084
I think that I had spent my whole life

00:10:09.032 --> 00:10:12.877
being what was known as a Soviet expert.

00:10:12.877 --> 00:10:16.395
I was somebody that spent
time doing content analysis

00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:18.475
by looking at Pravda and Vesti

00:10:18.475 --> 00:10:20.590
to see if five words
were in a different order

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.838
or whether the portraits in
the Kremlin were different.

00:10:24.838 --> 00:10:28.329
One of the great amazing
parts was to be president

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:32.700
at the time that the
Soviet Union fell apart.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.665
It was something that
the first President Bush

00:10:34.665 --> 00:10:36.082
had to deal with.

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:39.729
He is the one who actually said that

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:42.947
we wanted to have a Europe
that was whole and free.

00:10:42.947 --> 00:10:45.039
Then President Clinton came into office

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.851
and the question was how to operate.

00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:50.762
We were asked to do something
that had never been done

00:10:50.762 --> 00:10:52.450
in the history of the world,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.900
which is how to devolve the
power of your major adversary

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.966
in a respectful way.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:01.016
You can defeat your adversary
on the field of battle,

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:04.744
but I happen to believe that
we didn't win the Cold War,

00:11:04.744 --> 00:11:07.022
they lost the Cold War.

00:11:07.022 --> 00:11:08.995
That's not just a semantic difference

00:11:08.995 --> 00:11:10.973
because the place fell apart.

00:11:10.973 --> 00:11:15.588
The question was how to treat
them well and respectfully.

00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:18.065
That's why we created the G8,

00:11:18.065 --> 00:11:22.085
why in fact, we helped
in a financial crisis.

00:11:22.085 --> 00:11:24.226
We tried to figure out how to bring them

00:11:24.226 --> 00:11:26.802
into the international system.

00:11:26.802 --> 00:11:29.585
One of the things that we did decide to do

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:32.236
was the countries that
had been part of central

00:11:32.236 --> 00:11:36.126
and eastern Europe had been
stopped from being part

00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:38.506
of a Europe that was whole and free.

00:11:38.506 --> 00:11:41.659
So, in fact, we decided to expand NATO

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.751
and I went to see
President Putin about it.

00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:48.134
He said, "You don't need NATO
because this is a new Russia,"

00:11:48.134 --> 00:11:49.882
and I said, "Mr. President,

00:11:49.882 --> 00:11:53.092
"it is a new Russia,
and this is a new NATO,

00:11:53.092 --> 00:11:55.421
"and you can be a member of it."

00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:58.282
It was not something that
was done against them,

00:11:58.282 --> 00:12:01.698
it was something that many
of us felt was justified

00:12:01.698 --> 00:12:05.358
because of the way that
World War II had ended.

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:08.473
We spent a lot of time
trying to bring Russia

00:12:08.473 --> 00:12:09.757
into the system.

00:12:09.757 --> 00:12:13.006
That was the whole thing,
to make them part of it.

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:16.865
What has happened is that the game change,

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:20.208
all of a sudden, is
that Putin has decided,

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.233
he has his own version
of history, by the way.

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:24.414
He makes up facts.

00:12:24.414 --> 00:12:27.381
That's what they do in the KGB.

00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:32.097
The bottom line is that he is
living in his own set of facts

00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:36.010
and he sees a Europe
that is whole and free

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.490
as being anti-Russian, which it is not.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.786
He specifically has focused on Ukraine.

00:12:41.786 --> 00:12:44.231
Ukraine is a very complex country,

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.538
it is a neighboring state,

00:12:46.538 --> 00:12:50.153
and Crimea is a complicated history.

00:12:50.153 --> 00:12:52.613
There probably were ways to change.

00:12:52.613 --> 00:12:54.561
We've changed borders in countries

00:12:54.561 --> 00:12:56.865
as a result of negotiation.

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.441
Invasion is not the way to do it.

00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:02.460
I think the thing that
makes it a game changer

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.854
is that this is not the kind of behavior

00:13:05.854 --> 00:13:09.545
that we thought might be able
to work in the 21st century

00:13:09.545 --> 00:13:12.289
and trying to figure out
whether there's any way

00:13:12.289 --> 00:13:15.516
to work with Putin's Russia
because a lot of the people

00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:19.429
in Russia also wanna be a part of Europe.

00:13:19.429 --> 00:13:22.982
Putin has identified himself with an anger

00:13:22.982 --> 00:13:25.987
by some nationalist in Russia

00:13:25.987 --> 00:13:28.602
in terms of what's happened
to Russia's identity.

00:13:28.602 --> 00:13:30.602
The last thing, in 1991,

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:36.524
I was teaching at
Georgetown in the center.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:41.293
We went to do a lot of
survey work all over Europe,

00:13:41.293 --> 00:13:44.401
including in Russia,
and we had focus groups.

00:13:44.401 --> 00:13:47.322
There was this one focus
group that I'll never forget

00:13:47.322 --> 00:13:49.600
where this man stands up and he said,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.366
"I'm so embarrassed.

00:13:51.366 --> 00:13:52.938
"We used to be a superpower

00:13:52.938 --> 00:13:56.026
"and now we're just
Bangladesh with missiles."

00:13:56.026 --> 00:13:57.961
The bottom line is the Russians,

00:13:57.961 --> 00:14:01.128
it's a head case, psychologically,

00:14:01.128 --> 00:14:03.029
had lost their identity.

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:04.815
I think Putin has bought into that

00:14:04.815 --> 00:14:07.947
and he is trying to present a larger

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:12.082
nationalist Russia that can
have pride in its history,

00:14:12.082 --> 00:14:14.342
and I think they need to
have pride in their history,

00:14:14.342 --> 00:14:18.509
but it doesn't mean that they
have to dismember Ukraine.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.851
- I think of you as a person
who's brought a lot of wisdom

00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:25.601
from the 20th century
into state craft today.

00:14:27.092 --> 00:14:29.676
Certainly, that played a
big part in your thinking

00:14:29.676 --> 00:14:32.259
about the Balkans in the 1990s.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.346
When you look at someone
who is using a myth

00:14:37.346 --> 00:14:41.005
of a stab in the back,
as Putin has been using

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.925
about the west and the
period after the collapse

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:48.713
of the Soviet Union, has been
playing on ultra-nationalism,

00:14:48.713 --> 00:14:52.046
has been upholding himself as the keeper

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:57.696
of a certain kind of civilization,
a Russian civilization,

00:14:57.696 --> 00:15:00.551
it makes me very nervous.

00:15:00.551 --> 00:15:02.616
I'm wondering to what extent you feel like

00:15:02.616 --> 00:15:06.218
we're seeing a replay of
something very pernicious

00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:08.020
that we've seen before.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.345
- I'm very nervous, always,
about historical analogies.

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:14.379
What I always tell my
students, it's really important

00:15:14.379 --> 00:15:18.090
to know history but nothing
is exactly quite the same.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.850
What I do think is an
issue that we have watched,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.764
it was certainly true in the 20th century

00:15:23.764 --> 00:15:26.060
having begun in earlier centuries,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.816
is the role of nationalism.

00:15:27.816 --> 00:15:30.563
Nationalism is a very two-edged sword

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:34.086
in that people need to
have pride in their nation,

00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:37.777
patriotism, but when that
becomes something virulent,

00:15:37.777 --> 00:15:41.210
which in turn is hatred of
the people who live next door,

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.517
and is used for the purpose
of domestic politics

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:48.790
to divert attention from some
economic problems or whatever,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.902
then it's very dangerous.

00:15:50.902 --> 00:15:54.021
What I find troubling
is that's what destroyed

00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:58.264
large portions of Europe
during the first part

00:15:58.264 --> 00:16:01.333
of the 20th century and, to some extent,

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.985
because there have been a
variety of economic problems

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:06.800
in Europe, there are
questions about how well

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.725
the European Union functions,

00:16:08.725 --> 00:16:12.472
and in fact, there's some
return of nationalism generally.

00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:15.285
You can see what just happened
in the elections in Hungary,

00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:18.139
where really passing strange...

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.345
Viktor Orban, I met in the 80s

00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:23.271
and he was this young
student and very idealistic.

00:16:23.271 --> 00:16:25.718
All of a sudden, he's turned
into a hyper-nationalist

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:28.846
who thinks that Hungary should be larger.

00:16:28.846 --> 00:16:30.929
It is a dangerous aspect.

00:16:31.847 --> 00:16:34.787
You introduced me with my very long story

00:16:34.787 --> 00:16:37.718
and I am very sensitive to this

00:16:37.718 --> 00:16:40.590
as somebody who was
born in Czechoslovakia.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.804
Czechoslovakia was/is
a multi-ethnic country

00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:47.811
and one of the issues really was,

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:51.140
what happened to a very
large German minority?

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.929
Once Czechoslovakia had
been formed in 1918,

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:57.603
many Germans lived in
the northwestern part

00:16:57.603 --> 00:16:59.916
of Czechoslovakia, known as Sudetenland,

00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:02.107
'cause it's south of Germany.

00:17:02.107 --> 00:17:05.146
There were some people who lived there

00:17:05.146 --> 00:17:08.215
who felt that they had not
gotten the jobs they wanted

00:17:08.215 --> 00:17:10.840
but for the most part,
as I look at history,

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.501
it was fairly well, carefully done.

00:17:14.501 --> 00:17:16.426
They did have jobs, and there was a way

00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:18.525
to make everybody live together.

00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:22.633
There was a person there
who provoked problems.

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:26.234
His name was Konrad
Henlein, he was a Nazi,

00:17:26.234 --> 00:17:29.275
and so the issue came,
what was gonna happen

00:17:29.275 --> 00:17:32.177
to this part of the country?

00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.436
One of the parts,

00:17:33.436 --> 00:17:36.205
this is why I try to
be careful about this,

00:17:36.205 --> 00:17:38.802
is that people were concerned

00:17:38.802 --> 00:17:41.093
about what was going to happen,

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:43.176
and the issue was Munich.

00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:48.750
What happened was that the
Germans and the Italians

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.296
made a deal with the British and French

00:17:51.296 --> 00:17:53.396
over the heads of the Czechoslovaks.

00:17:53.396 --> 00:17:56.544
They never were at the table.

00:17:56.544 --> 00:18:00.268
The country was sold down the river.

00:18:00.268 --> 00:18:04.510
I think one has to be
careful not to exclude,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.719
in this case the Ukranians
have to be at the table.

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:11.469
You cannot have somebody
who uses provocation

00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:15.857
in order to separate one part
of a country from another.

00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:18.414
We don't have to go into
all the motivations of it,

00:18:18.414 --> 00:18:20.319
but these kinds of things have happened

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:22.608
and they are very dangerous.

00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:25.923
You never know when they're gonna stop.

00:18:25.923 --> 00:18:28.944
- As we think forward about what we can do

00:18:28.944 --> 00:18:32.277
to redress the problem or ameliorate it,

00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:36.750
there is no military
option, as we all know.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.223
Whether it's Bangladesh or not,

00:18:38.223 --> 00:18:40.562
it has a lot of nuclear weapons

00:18:40.562 --> 00:18:42.424
and no one wants to see blood shed

00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:44.591
on the European continent.

00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:47.803
Unilateral sanctions by the United States

00:18:47.803 --> 00:18:49.355
aren't gonna make any difference.

00:18:49.355 --> 00:18:52.716
In fact, they will probably
make us look weak, if anything.

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.429
I guess the question I have
for you is do you see the west

00:18:55.429 --> 00:18:58.432
coming together around this issue

00:18:58.432 --> 00:19:02.071
and taking the kind of
action that is necessary?

00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:05.091
I think this is really
a moment when Europe

00:19:05.091 --> 00:19:07.768
needs to be heard from.

00:19:07.768 --> 00:19:10.851
- I thought, last week, that in fact,

00:19:12.532 --> 00:19:14.960
Putin, who had tried to divide Europe,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.062
had actually united it.

00:19:17.062 --> 00:19:19.057
What I thought was very interesting,

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:22.590
President Obama had been
scheduled to go to Europe.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.417
These were previously scheduled meetings

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:27.738
that were taking place in
Brussels and The Hague.

00:19:27.738 --> 00:19:30.669
In fact, he brought a
lot of leaders together.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.712
I think that there was
a very strong statement

00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.379
in terms of support.

00:19:36.373 --> 00:19:38.662
The hope is that it will last.

00:19:38.662 --> 00:19:40.735
In terms of reading
the paper this morning,

00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:42.616
there are already some questions

00:19:42.616 --> 00:19:44.579
about where the Germans are on this.

00:19:44.579 --> 00:19:49.069
This is the problem, if I
could state it this way.

00:19:49.069 --> 00:19:51.583
First of all, at Georgetown
I teach a course.

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:54.406
I say foreign policy's just
trying to get some country

00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:56.517
to do what you want is all it is.

00:19:56.517 --> 00:19:59.064
The bottom line is, what are the tools?

00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.609
So there are not a lot of tools

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:03.021
in that national security toolbox.

00:20:03.021 --> 00:20:06.218
There is diplomacy,
bilateral, multilateral,

00:20:06.218 --> 00:20:08.595
on one end and the use
of force on the other,

00:20:08.595 --> 00:20:10.008
the threat of the use of force.

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:11.686
As you know, when we
were in the government,

00:20:11.686 --> 00:20:12.597
people would say,

00:20:12.597 --> 00:20:13.811
"Don't threaten the use of force

00:20:13.811 --> 00:20:15.349
"unless you're prepared to use it."

00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:16.253
- [Daniel] Right.

00:20:16.253 --> 00:20:18.215
- Law enforcement, intelligence,

00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.615
and in the middle are the economic tools.

00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:22.547
The carrots, which are trade and aid,

00:20:22.547 --> 00:20:25.547
and sanctions, which are the sticks.

00:20:27.002 --> 00:20:29.655
We always like to choose the middle option

00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:33.822
and so in many ways, sanctions
are the tool of choice.

00:20:34.819 --> 00:20:38.144
Diplomacy, you do all the
time and the use of force

00:20:38.144 --> 00:20:39.970
brings its own problems.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.886
The question is always between unilateral

00:20:41.886 --> 00:20:43.753
and multilateral sanctions.

00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:46.374
The problem with sanctions is
they take quite a long time

00:20:46.374 --> 00:20:47.624
to take effect.

00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:51.697
It is a matter of cutting
off a variety of people

00:20:51.697 --> 00:20:55.092
from their capabilities of
carrying on economic life

00:20:55.092 --> 00:20:58.189
and what is interesting
is often the countries,

00:20:58.189 --> 00:21:00.457
the targeting countries,

00:21:00.457 --> 00:21:03.506
also absorb the problems of sanctions

00:21:03.506 --> 00:21:06.262
as well as the targeted countries.

00:21:06.262 --> 00:21:08.788
There's some pain to it.

00:21:08.788 --> 00:21:11.404
There is the evident problem in Europe,

00:21:11.404 --> 00:21:13.832
which is even more
dependent in terms of trade

00:21:13.832 --> 00:21:15.419
and issues with the Russians

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:19.275
as to whether they're gonna
suck it up and deal with it.

00:21:19.275 --> 00:21:20.560
That is the question.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.798
We are operating with
democracies that obviously

00:21:23.798 --> 00:21:26.246
have to have the support of their people

00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:29.335
and the sanctions take
a while to take hold.

00:21:29.335 --> 00:21:32.077
I do think that the point has to be made

00:21:32.077 --> 00:21:35.006
over and over again that
this is a game changer,

00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:37.506
that many things could
change in Europe if,

00:21:37.506 --> 00:21:41.651
in fact, there is not a
unified approach to it.

00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:44.818
What is making people nervous right now,

00:21:44.818 --> 00:21:47.620
Crimea, we can talk about
because it is a very

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.953
historically peculiar place in that way,

00:21:51.845 --> 00:21:54.944
but the bottom line is
there are Russian speaking

00:21:54.944 --> 00:21:59.533
populations in the Baltics, in
Latvia more than the others.

00:21:59.533 --> 00:22:02.085
There's the issue of Moldova,

00:22:02.085 --> 00:22:04.835
where there already is
this kind of peculiar place

00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:07.221
called Transnistria.

00:22:07.221 --> 00:22:09.363
The question is, to go back to your issue,

00:22:09.363 --> 00:22:12.381
is do you protect some
kind of an ethnic group?

00:22:12.381 --> 00:22:14.677
These are multi-ethnic societies

00:22:14.677 --> 00:22:16.329
and there's always some group

00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:19.883
that is ready to be
paid to be provocative.

00:22:19.883 --> 00:22:24.251
That's the danger, is
that this will spread

00:22:24.251 --> 00:22:27.755
and if we don't stand up in
some way, in a unified way,

00:22:27.755 --> 00:22:31.064
then the issue of Europe
Poland-free is a real question.

00:22:31.064 --> 00:22:33.934
I believe that the United
States is much stronger

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:38.258
when it has a unified
Europe working together

00:22:38.258 --> 00:22:39.571
so we can deal with the problems

00:22:39.571 --> 00:22:42.321
in some other parts of the world.

00:22:43.744 --> 00:22:45.963
- One of the first things
that you learn in diplomacy,

00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:48.519
of course, is that
everything is connected,

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:51.008
much to one's frustration.

00:22:51.008 --> 00:22:52.724
When we look at some
of the other key issues

00:22:52.724 --> 00:22:54.618
that we're dealing with around the world,

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:57.535
they depend on Russian cooperation.

00:22:58.415 --> 00:23:01.612
How do we go forward now, in
terms of dealing with Iran

00:23:01.612 --> 00:23:03.539
and its nuclear program?

00:23:03.539 --> 00:23:05.582
We weren't getting a lot of
cooperation of the Russians

00:23:05.582 --> 00:23:09.410
on Syria, but there too, the
structure of the international

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.471
community is such that it's
very hard to make any progress

00:23:12.471 --> 00:23:14.238
without Russia.

00:23:14.238 --> 00:23:17.712
How do we get ourselves
out of this Gordian knot?

00:23:17.712 --> 00:23:19.771
- I think one has to make the assumptions

00:23:19.771 --> 00:23:23.781
that the Russian foreign
policy is not altruistic

00:23:23.781 --> 00:23:26.614
as far as either Iran
or Syria's concerned,

00:23:26.614 --> 00:23:29.741
that they have national interest
that they wanna deal with.

00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:32.935
So I think that you're absolutely right,

00:23:32.935 --> 00:23:34.209
everything is connected,

00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:37.132
but we just shouldn't say that it is.

00:23:37.132 --> 00:23:41.614
Basically, there's P5+1
meetings going on in Vienna now

00:23:41.614 --> 00:23:44.416
on Iran, and the question
is how the Russians

00:23:44.416 --> 00:23:45.887
are gonna behave in there.

00:23:45.887 --> 00:23:48.725
Theoretically, they also don't wanna see

00:23:48.725 --> 00:23:50.475
a nuclear armed Iran.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.637
On Syria, again, this was
not done out of altruism,

00:23:57.818 --> 00:24:00.203
they are concerned, were concerned,

00:24:00.203 --> 00:24:04.298
about the spread of chemical
weapons into various parts

00:24:04.298 --> 00:24:08.465
of Russia, frankly, in terms
of extremist groups, et cetera.

00:24:09.453 --> 00:24:12.689
They wanted to get some control
over the chemical weapons.

00:24:12.689 --> 00:24:15.390
They haven't exactly shown
that they are helpful

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.894
when we talk about humanitarian
assistance in Syria,

00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:20.455
so I think that we just have to assume

00:24:20.455 --> 00:24:24.167
that there are certain areas
where the Russians will see

00:24:24.167 --> 00:24:28.334
their realistic approach that
they need to work with us.

00:24:30.863 --> 00:24:32.446
A lot depends on the mood,

00:24:32.446 --> 00:24:36.814
a lot depends on whether they
actually look at it that way.

00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:40.665
Part of the deal was here that we thought

00:24:40.665 --> 00:24:42.453
that we were gonna make Russia

00:24:42.453 --> 00:24:44.294
a part of the international system

00:24:44.294 --> 00:24:47.413
where they would actually be
helpful on certain issues.

00:24:47.413 --> 00:24:51.522
We need them on some issues
to do with climate change

00:24:51.522 --> 00:24:53.100
or ships in the Arctic

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.267
or some in tracking terrorists
in a variety of ways.

00:24:58.598 --> 00:25:01.844
I think that the effort should be,

00:25:01.844 --> 00:25:03.698
this is the hard part,

00:25:03.698 --> 00:25:06.677
is how you begin to
isolate them on one part

00:25:06.677 --> 00:25:09.145
and then try to figure out
how to really involve them

00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:11.296
in some of the other issues.

00:25:11.296 --> 00:25:13.210
It is difficult, there's no question.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.987
We don't wanna completely never
speak to the Russians again.

00:25:17.987 --> 00:25:22.154
So how we divide this is part
of the difficulty of this.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.368
- I think one of the questions
that's being asked now

00:25:26.368 --> 00:25:30.451
is whether we should look back and examine

00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:34.667
what we did in the 90s when
we went to the Madrid Summit,

00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:38.070
you were at the front of
the bus, I was in the back,

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.352
for NATO enlargement.

00:25:39.352 --> 00:25:41.950
I guess the question is,

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.050
do you think that that bears reexamination

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.035
or did we do the right thing then

00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:48.282
and we need to march forward?

00:25:48.282 --> 00:25:49.578
- I think we did the right thing.

00:25:49.578 --> 00:25:52.772
It was not done just off
the top of our heads.

00:25:52.772 --> 00:25:56.050
I think the thing that
has to be remembered,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:26:00.206
and this has been very
much a part of the life

00:26:00.206 --> 00:26:02.956
that I've been involved in ...

00:26:02.956 --> 00:26:06.553
The United States, by the way,
at the end of World War II,

00:26:06.553 --> 00:26:10.136
offered the Soviet
Union the Marshall Plan.

00:26:11.254 --> 00:26:15.087
What was interesting,
Czechoslovakia accepted.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.388
What happened was that
the foreign minister

00:26:20.388 --> 00:26:22.193
of Czechoslovakia, Jan Masaryk,

00:26:22.193 --> 00:26:25.527
was summoned to Moscow and told flat out

00:26:25.527 --> 00:26:29.289
that they couldn't
accept the Marshall Plan.

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:31.282
My father was actually Chief of Staff

00:26:31.282 --> 00:26:32.799
to the foreign ministry at the time

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.658
and he reported on the fact that Masaryk

00:26:34.658 --> 00:26:36.511
came back from Moscow and said,

00:26:36.511 --> 00:26:38.634
"I now know that I'm
not the foreign minister

00:26:38.634 --> 00:26:41.002
"of a sovereign country."

00:26:41.002 --> 00:26:44.249
What happened after
World War II as a result

00:26:44.249 --> 00:26:47.284
of agreements made during World War II,

00:26:47.284 --> 00:26:51.086
the Red Army "liberated"
central and eastern Europe.

00:26:51.086 --> 00:26:54.154
As a result of a variety
of salami tactics,

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.900
one after another, became
a communist country.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.048
Czechoslovakia was the last one.

00:26:59.048 --> 00:27:02.881
There was a coup in 1948,
a complicated story,

00:27:04.341 --> 00:27:07.844
and as a result of that,
NATO was formed in '49.

00:27:07.844 --> 00:27:11.317
All of a sudden, the United
States saw what was going on

00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:13.562
in terms of the salami tactics

00:27:13.562 --> 00:27:15.895
of creating the Soviet Bloc.

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:21.475
So NATO was formed and these
people that had wanted to be

00:27:21.475 --> 00:27:23.752
part of the west at
the end of World War II

00:27:23.752 --> 00:27:25.720
were excluded from it.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.103
Instead, they were made to be
members to the Warsaw Pact.

00:27:29.103 --> 00:27:30.620
The Warsaw Pact falls apart.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.370
We didn't destroy the Warsaw Pact.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:34.394
Nobody wanted to be members of it.

00:27:34.394 --> 00:27:36.997
The question was, how do you ...

00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:39.210
When I was talking about
this survey that I did,

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.479
we went all over and people in Poland,

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:44.510
and Hungary, and Czechoslovakia would say,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.104
"We just wanna be Europeans."

00:27:47.104 --> 00:27:50.902
The question was, being a part of NATO

00:27:50.902 --> 00:27:53.235
was part of being Europeans.

00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:56.095
I think it was the right thing to do.

00:27:56.095 --> 00:27:58.845
I went around and we talked first

00:28:00.023 --> 00:28:02.786
about the Partnership for
Peace and trying to figure out

00:28:02.786 --> 00:28:05.114
how to bring these countries in.

00:28:05.114 --> 00:28:08.281
NATO is not a charitable organization.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:13.335
You have to, in fact,
fulfill certain commitments

00:28:13.335 --> 00:28:15.497
and these countries
were prepared to do it.

00:28:15.497 --> 00:28:17.675
I think it was the right thing to do.

00:28:17.675 --> 00:28:20.803
One of the things I was asked to do,

00:28:20.803 --> 00:28:23.549
it had just been the
60th anniversary of NATO,

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:26.907
the heads of state met in Strasbourg Kehl,

00:28:26.907 --> 00:28:29.304
and a new Secretary General was named.

00:28:29.304 --> 00:28:31.422
Then the heads of states also decided

00:28:31.422 --> 00:28:34.752
that there needed to be a new
strategic concept for NATO

00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:36.834
and that there should
be a group of experts

00:28:36.834 --> 00:28:38.500
that would work on it.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.476
Every country named an expert,

00:28:40.476 --> 00:28:43.170
and the United States named me.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.413
Secretary General Rasmussen decided

00:28:45.413 --> 00:28:46.775
that the group of experts

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:49.904
would have 12 countries represented,

00:28:49.904 --> 00:28:52.496
automatically irritating 16 countries,

00:28:52.496 --> 00:28:54.420
and then he asked me to chair it.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.930
We looked at what the
new strategic concept

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.246
for NATO was supposed to be.

00:28:59.246 --> 00:29:03.433
This organization that had been
created during the Cold War,

00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:06.282
most powerful military alliance
in the history of the world,

00:29:06.282 --> 00:29:08.070
what was its mandate?

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.504
We began to look more and
more at out of area aspects

00:29:11.504 --> 00:29:14.590
such as, some had been in Bosnia,

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:16.654
but then also in Afghanistan,

00:29:16.654 --> 00:29:19.114
what were the different
things that NATO was gonna do?

00:29:19.114 --> 00:29:21.114
It was not anti-Russian.

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:24.893
For his own historical purposes,

00:29:24.893 --> 00:29:27.572
I think that Putin, he needs an enemy.

00:29:27.572 --> 00:29:30.275
I think we should now allow that

00:29:30.275 --> 00:29:32.533
to undermine the existence of NATO.

00:29:32.533 --> 00:29:35.643
I think it was the right thing to do.

00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:37.823
- Let's talk for a moment
about other challenges

00:29:37.823 --> 00:29:40.073
that seem to never go away.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:44.220
We're now in a pause to
reassess the Middle East

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.887
peace process talks.

00:29:47.297 --> 00:29:51.460
This has been quite a
soap opera, if you will.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.761
We've gone, it seems, over the brink,

00:29:53.761 --> 00:29:55.349
although you never really
know in the Middle East

00:29:55.349 --> 00:29:57.799
when you're over the
brink, or on the edge,

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:00.117
or coming back from the brink.

00:30:00.117 --> 00:30:01.983
You had long experience

00:30:01.983 --> 00:30:04.736
wrestling with some of the personalities

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:06.736
involved in these talks.

00:30:08.219 --> 00:30:10.963
I'm curious what you
think about prospects now.

00:30:10.963 --> 00:30:14.526
The word on the street in
international relations,

00:30:14.526 --> 00:30:17.161
if you will, is that
the two-state solution

00:30:17.161 --> 00:30:18.394
may be at an end.

00:30:18.394 --> 00:30:21.740
I'm wondering what your
thoughts are on that.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.823
- I am an optimist who worries a lot.

00:30:27.827 --> 00:30:29.131
Let me just say this.

00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:32.650
I think that this is a
constantly iterative story

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.160
and even though there are
an awful lot of people here,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.233
if I were to invite you
to come to Camp David,

00:30:37.233 --> 00:30:38.958
you might think it would be fun.

00:30:38.958 --> 00:30:40.756
I can tell you, after
two weeks in the rain

00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.500
with the Israelis and Palestinians,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.919
I don't care if I ever go back.

00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:48.829
It has been very much a back and forth,

00:30:48.829 --> 00:30:52.527
some of it drama and some
of it just the difficulty

00:30:52.527 --> 00:30:54.335
of working out the issues.

00:30:54.335 --> 00:30:57.047
I think we know what the answers are.

00:30:57.047 --> 00:30:58.529
When President Clinton left office,

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:00.849
he laid down the Clinton Parameters.

00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:04.026
They're only a limited
number of solutions here

00:31:04.026 --> 00:31:08.674
and the two-state solution
has been a part of it.

00:31:08.674 --> 00:31:11.299
I hate to think it's the end
of the two-state solution.

00:31:11.299 --> 00:31:13.834
I know that there are real questions

00:31:13.834 --> 00:31:17.289
as to whether there should be one state.

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:21.323
I think if one believes that
Israel is a Jewish state,

00:31:21.323 --> 00:31:24.046
which I do, then there's
the question about

00:31:24.046 --> 00:31:28.329
what happens to the variety
of Palestinians and Arabs

00:31:28.329 --> 00:31:30.046
that live in Israel?

00:31:30.046 --> 00:31:32.789
Israel is a democracy and therefore,

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:35.395
having people vote and be a part of it

00:31:35.395 --> 00:31:37.228
is the issue, frankly.

00:31:39.394 --> 00:31:42.306
In terms of demography, what does that do?

00:31:42.306 --> 00:31:45.760
I think the two-state
solution is the only solution.

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.441
The question is, since we
know what the answers are

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:51.404
and the United States has done ...

00:31:51.404 --> 00:31:54.227
I think Secretary Kerry
has been remarkable

00:31:54.227 --> 00:31:57.891
in his dedication and doggedness to this,

00:31:57.891 --> 00:32:01.530
but ultimately, it's the leaders
in the countries themselves

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:04.197
that have to make the decisions.

00:32:05.218 --> 00:32:09.423
The question is exactly, whether
they look at the precipice

00:32:09.423 --> 00:32:13.716
and think, "I'll never fall
in, the other guy will,"

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:18.518
or whether they actually see
that their futures are linked

00:32:18.518 --> 00:32:20.919
and that they have to
go back to the table.

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:23.252
This is a pretty dicey time.

00:32:25.472 --> 00:32:27.485
I have been an optimist,

00:32:27.485 --> 00:32:31.699
unnecessarily so or unrequitedly
so, for a long time,

00:32:31.699 --> 00:32:35.774
but I do think that is the only solution.

00:32:35.774 --> 00:32:39.795
- I'm reminded of something
Vaclav Hovel said to you once

00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:42.765
after you gave a speech in Prague.

00:32:42.765 --> 00:32:46.979
That's a speech no Czech
diplomat or statesman

00:32:46.979 --> 00:32:49.161
could've ever given because
it was too optimistic.

00:32:49.161 --> 00:32:50.051
- Right.

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.055
- But you gave it in Czech.

00:32:51.055 --> 00:32:54.805
- No, but I mean everybody
has their history.

00:32:55.745 --> 00:32:58.245
Why wouldn't I be an optimist?

00:32:59.216 --> 00:33:02.985
I grew up in Czechoslovakia,
I came to the United States,

00:33:02.985 --> 00:33:04.535
I got to be an American citizen,

00:33:04.535 --> 00:33:07.114
and I ended up as Secretary
of State, not so bad.

00:33:07.114 --> 00:33:09.324
- Not so bad, no.

00:33:09.324 --> 00:33:11.574
(applause)

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:17.719
Actually, that reminds me of the story

00:33:17.719 --> 00:33:20.395
that the President told
when you were given

00:33:20.395 --> 00:33:24.334
the Medal of Freedom,
where an Ethiopian man,

00:33:24.334 --> 00:33:25.982
you were at a naturalization ceremony

00:33:25.982 --> 00:33:28.487
and an Ethiopian man
came up to you and said,

00:33:28.487 --> 00:33:32.749
"Only in America can a refugee
meet the Secretary of State,"

00:33:32.749 --> 00:33:34.071
and you responded ...

00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:38.485
- Only in America can a refugee
become Secretary of State.

00:33:38.485 --> 00:33:40.436
One of the things I love
to do, I have to say,

00:33:40.436 --> 00:33:44.150
is go to naturalization ceremonies.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:45.956
The most amazing one, frankly,

00:33:45.956 --> 00:33:48.018
and you were talking
about Thomas Jefferson,

00:33:48.018 --> 00:33:52.018
was the one during the
millennium in Monticello.

00:33:52.923 --> 00:33:55.518
It was an incredible ceremony for people

00:33:55.518 --> 00:33:57.096
that have been in Monticello.

00:33:57.096 --> 00:33:59.017
It was beautiful.

00:33:59.017 --> 00:34:01.203
It, obviously, was outside.

00:34:01.203 --> 00:34:04.024
I am not an officer of the
law so I could not administer

00:34:04.024 --> 00:34:06.470
the oath of office, but then I went around

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.709
and I gave everybody their
naturalization certificate.

00:34:09.709 --> 00:34:13.407
I said to them, "I have
exactly the same certificate.

00:34:13.407 --> 00:34:16.686
"It's the most important piece
of paper you will ever get.

00:34:16.686 --> 00:34:18.103
"Keep it safely."

00:34:22.173 --> 00:34:25.005
- You've been very busy, and
you've been very, very busy

00:34:25.005 --> 00:34:26.978
for a long time.

00:34:26.978 --> 00:34:28.673
- I am really old.

00:34:28.673 --> 00:34:30.344
(laughter)

00:34:30.344 --> 00:34:31.221
- That wasn't what I meant.

00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:32.054
- I know.

00:34:32.986 --> 00:34:35.442
I went to college at a
time somewhere between

00:34:35.442 --> 00:34:39.019
the invention of the iPad
and the discovery of fire.

00:34:39.019 --> 00:34:41.493
(laughter)

00:34:41.493 --> 00:34:45.293
- I think you were a
little closer to the iPad.

00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:48.460
I wanted to ask you about, first of all,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.106
what the secret of your energy is,

00:34:51.106 --> 00:34:52.960
and second of all, how you've managed

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.843
to keep all the balls in the air?

00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:58.635
I was mentioning to
Secretary Albright before

00:34:58.635 --> 00:35:01.380
that probably the last time
we had half this many people

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.894
in one auditorium here at Dartmouth

00:35:04.894 --> 00:35:07.292
was when Anne-Marie
Slaughter was here last year,

00:35:07.292 --> 00:35:09.562
not talking about Syria or foreign policy,

00:35:09.562 --> 00:35:11.592
but about work/life balance.

00:35:11.592 --> 00:35:14.654
In the interim, we've had
Sheryl Sandberg's book,

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:17.679
Lean In, and this has been a big debate.

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:19.724
You were dealing with
these questions long before

00:35:19.724 --> 00:35:22.499
any of us knew you could get
a really big book contract

00:35:22.499 --> 00:35:23.332
out of it.

00:35:24.572 --> 00:35:28.105
I'm curious to know how you've
balanced all these things

00:35:28.105 --> 00:35:30.076
and how you feel about this debate.

00:35:30.076 --> 00:35:34.076
- Let me say that I did
go to a women's college.

00:35:36.394 --> 00:35:39.061
I loved Wellesley, I graduated.

00:35:40.312 --> 00:35:42.759
Most people thought about getting married.

00:35:42.759 --> 00:35:46.618
I waited a really long time,
three days after graduation.

00:35:46.618 --> 00:35:48.769
(laughter)

00:35:48.769 --> 00:35:51.414
You told part of the
story, but part of it was

00:35:51.414 --> 00:35:54.266
it didn't occur to me that I
couldn't do what I want to do.

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:55.973
I wanted to be a journalist.

00:35:55.973 --> 00:35:58.873
I had this job that you describe
at the Rolla Daily News.

00:35:58.873 --> 00:36:01.154
Then my husband was a reporter,

00:36:01.154 --> 00:36:03.336
and we moved back to Chicago.

00:36:03.336 --> 00:36:06.335
We were having dinner
with his managing editor.

00:36:06.335 --> 00:36:07.693
He looks at me and he says,

00:36:07.693 --> 00:36:09.474
"So what are you gonna do, honey?"

00:36:09.474 --> 00:36:11.157
I said, "I'm gonna work on a newspaper."

00:36:11.157 --> 00:36:12.856
He said, "I don't think so.

00:36:12.856 --> 00:36:14.889
"You can't work on the
same paper as your husband

00:36:14.889 --> 00:36:17.947
"because of labor guild regulations,"

00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:20.131
and even though there were
three other papers in Chicago

00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:21.881
at the time, he said,

00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:24.582
"You wouldn't wanna
compete with your husband."

00:36:24.582 --> 00:36:26.171
I know exactly what I would say now

00:36:26.171 --> 00:36:29.161
or what some of the people
in the audience might say,

00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:32.131
but at the time, I just
saluted and found another life.

00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:34.095
I did do the Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:36:34.095 --> 00:36:37.026
which for the younger people
in the audience, is a book.

00:36:37.026 --> 00:36:39.276
(laughter)

00:36:41.162 --> 00:36:44.033
Among the things I did was
not only select the pictures,

00:36:44.033 --> 00:36:46.638
but there was a time
that newspaper columns

00:36:46.638 --> 00:36:48.444
needed to be justified at the bottom

00:36:48.444 --> 00:36:50.897
and so they needed some factoid.

00:36:50.897 --> 00:36:52.892
I read the Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:36:52.892 --> 00:36:57.534
so I knew things like
ostriches are voiceless.

00:36:57.534 --> 00:37:00.514
So then we moved again
because that's what one does

00:37:00.514 --> 00:37:05.072
when you're married, and
we moved to Long Island.

00:37:05.072 --> 00:37:08.375
All of a sudden, I was very fat.

00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:11.113
They didn't have sonograms
and they kept saying,

00:37:11.113 --> 00:37:12.790
"You're so fat," and then it turned out

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.373
I was having twins.

00:37:15.553 --> 00:37:18.480
I had to leave my twins in
incubators in the hospital.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.544
I had always wanted to learn Russian.

00:37:21.544 --> 00:37:24.896
Because I was Czech, I knew
that first year Russian

00:37:24.896 --> 00:37:27.780
would be too easy, but I didn't
know second year Russian.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.899
So as I left the children
in the incubators,

00:37:29.899 --> 00:37:32.083
I started taking Russian.

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:35.969
I did that and that really
led me to graduate school.

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:38.922
Part of the thing was,
and this is hard to say,

00:37:38.922 --> 00:37:42.505
is that every woman's
middle name is guilt.

00:37:43.606 --> 00:37:47.103
You're never quite in the right place,

00:37:47.103 --> 00:37:51.189
especially in that era 'cause
I was going to graduate school

00:37:51.189 --> 00:37:54.060
and doing my period of good works.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.539
The people that made me feel the worst

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.662
were other women who said,

00:37:57.662 --> 00:38:00.100
"Don't you think you should
be in the carpool line,"

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.727
or whatever.

00:38:01.727 --> 00:38:05.894
So this balance was something
that was hard to deal with.

00:38:06.807 --> 00:38:08.662
I think every woman in
this room asks herself

00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:11.399
whether she's a good mother or not.

00:38:11.399 --> 00:38:13.899
I finally did go get this job.

00:38:14.942 --> 00:38:17.409
My youngest daughter at
the time was eight or nine.

00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:19.350
I said, "Katie, do you care?"

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.496
She said, "But Mom, at least
I'll know where you are."

00:38:23.496 --> 00:38:26.363
I was working for Senator
Muskie and I had always agreed

00:38:26.363 --> 00:38:28.699
that I would always take the
phone call from my children

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:29.915
no matter what.

00:38:29.915 --> 00:38:32.678
One time, I was on the Senate
floor with Senator Muskie.

00:38:32.678 --> 00:38:34.887
Katie called and they said,

00:38:34.887 --> 00:38:36.276
"Your mother can't talk to you.

00:38:36.276 --> 00:38:37.954
"She's on the floor with Senator Muskie."

00:38:37.954 --> 00:38:39.235
So when I came home, Katie said,

00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:42.460
"What are you doing on
the floor with Senator?"

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.710
(laughter)

00:38:46.082 --> 00:38:49.182
The question was how to
make that balance work

00:38:49.182 --> 00:38:51.823
and it never was particularly easy,

00:38:51.823 --> 00:38:53.948
but I have talked to my three daughters,

00:38:53.948 --> 00:38:56.653
who now are all married and have children,

00:38:56.653 --> 00:38:58.962
and the issues are always the same.

00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:02.879
They really are that you
do feel it's not easy.

00:39:03.766 --> 00:39:06.301
There's no one formula.

00:39:06.301 --> 00:39:10.042
I think that Anne-Marie has
talked about the necessity

00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:14.570
of having the workplace a
little bit more adjusted.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:16.587
Sheryl talks in a different way,

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:20.169
and it's a perfect example
that there is no one answer.

00:39:20.169 --> 00:39:24.892
What I believe is, obviously,
men are an important part

00:39:24.892 --> 00:39:27.610
in making this work, but so are the women.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.857
The single most famous thing I ever said

00:39:30.857 --> 00:39:32.742
was that there's a special place in hell

00:39:32.742 --> 00:39:35.307
for women who don't help
each other, and part of it

00:39:35.307 --> 00:39:38.742
has to do with not making
each other feel guilty.

00:39:38.742 --> 00:39:40.992
(applause)

00:39:47.642 --> 00:39:50.554
- Of course, since you
were Secretary of State,

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.396
it seems as though women have pretty much

00:39:52.396 --> 00:39:54.729
had a lock on that position.

00:39:57.077 --> 00:40:00.043
Secretary Kerry's trying
to claw that turf back,

00:40:00.043 --> 00:40:04.518
but I'm curious what your
evaluation is of the progress

00:40:04.518 --> 00:40:07.913
of women in both the foreign policy field

00:40:07.913 --> 00:40:10.646
but in Washington, more broadly.

00:40:10.646 --> 00:40:13.291
- It's improved, but it's
not completely there,

00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:14.805
I don't think.

00:40:14.805 --> 00:40:17.941
By the way, my youngest
granddaughter said,

00:40:17.941 --> 00:40:19.794
four years ago when she
was seven, she said,

00:40:19.794 --> 00:40:21.809
"So what's the big deal
about Grandma Maddie

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:23.000
"being Secretary of State?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.447
"Only girls are Secretary of State."

00:40:25.447 --> 00:40:27.817
That is very different
than when my name came up

00:40:27.817 --> 00:40:28.865
and people were saying,

00:40:28.865 --> 00:40:31.875
"Can a woman possibly
be Secretary of State?"

00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:35.386
I think that there are
more women in Congress,

00:40:35.386 --> 00:40:39.168
and I think I'm often
asked whether there's a way

00:40:39.168 --> 00:40:41.171
there could be more women in Congress

00:40:41.171 --> 00:40:44.566
as there are in parliaments
in the Scandinavian countries.

00:40:44.566 --> 00:40:47.160
I think Americans don't
like the idea of quotas

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.841
or something like that, but I
do think that there need to be

00:40:50.841 --> 00:40:53.335
more women in Congress.

00:40:53.335 --> 00:40:56.961
I happen to believe, I vote on the issues.

00:40:56.961 --> 00:41:00.366
I would prefer to have a
man who believes in choice

00:41:00.366 --> 00:41:01.863
than Sarah Palin.

00:41:01.863 --> 00:41:04.981
So it is not a matter of ...

00:41:04.981 --> 00:41:07.231
(applause)

00:41:08.484 --> 00:41:11.586
I do think that one of
the things that we know

00:41:11.586 --> 00:41:13.003
is that, in fact,

00:41:15.262 --> 00:41:18.000
more things happen if
you have support group

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.481
within a system.

00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:22.565
So if there are more women
in the State Department

00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:24.501
or the National Security Council,

00:41:24.501 --> 00:41:27.827
or if in other countries,
there are more women

00:41:27.827 --> 00:41:32.220
in ministerial posts and
more women are politically

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.592
and economically empowered,
then it does make a difference.

00:41:35.592 --> 00:41:37.461
I think there should be more.

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:40.881
I happen to think that men
and women working together

00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:43.401
on these issues is very important.

00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.178
I know one of the issues,
one of the students

00:41:45.178 --> 00:41:47.011
asked me this earlier,

00:41:49.238 --> 00:41:50.869
do women think differently?

00:41:50.869 --> 00:41:55.036
I do think, in some ways,
in terms of the more empathy

00:41:56.645 --> 00:41:58.240
in a number of ways, putting yourself

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.609
into the other person's shoes.

00:42:00.609 --> 00:42:02.300
I'm often asked would the world be better

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.222
if it were completely run by women?

00:42:04.222 --> 00:42:05.072
I say no.

00:42:05.072 --> 00:42:07.803
If you think that, you've
forgotten high school.

00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:09.652
The bottom line is that you need

00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:12.235
men and women working together.

00:42:13.141 --> 00:42:16.530
- You mentioned empathy and I'm reminded,

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.123
having leafed through
your autobiography again,

00:42:20.123 --> 00:42:23.695
that you achieved a rare kind of fame,

00:42:23.695 --> 00:42:27.096
famous in the way that
you actually get mentioned

00:42:27.096 --> 00:42:29.726
in New Yorker cartoons,
which doesn't happen

00:42:29.726 --> 00:42:31.492
to very many of us.

00:42:31.492 --> 00:42:33.768
One of my absolute
favorites is of the woman

00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:37.690
trying on the dress in the
shop and the very happy

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:41.715
shop assistant beams
at that woman and says,

00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:45.882
"Madeleine Albright just
kicked butt in that dress."

00:42:46.925 --> 00:42:49.115
Well, so much for empathy.

00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:51.365
(laughter)

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:56.095
- One of the reasons that I
actually leg press 450 pounds

00:42:56.095 --> 00:42:57.512
is so that I can.

00:43:00.396 --> 00:43:03.563
- We'll keep that in mind over dinner.

00:43:04.965 --> 00:43:08.172
- One of the other things I
have to say really impressed me

00:43:08.172 --> 00:43:12.089
about your autobiography
was how you humanized,

00:43:12.995 --> 00:43:16.758
in many ways, the position
of Secretary of State.

00:43:16.758 --> 00:43:19.787
Your predecessor was a great
man, Warren Christopher,

00:43:19.787 --> 00:43:23.307
but warm and fuzzy was not his long suit.

00:43:23.307 --> 00:43:26.251
I have to say that in reading your book,

00:43:26.251 --> 00:43:28.537
you get such a strong
feeling of what it's like

00:43:28.537 --> 00:43:31.468
to be a person in these situations.

00:43:31.468 --> 00:43:33.850
It's, of course, an
autobiography, not just a memoir

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.433
of your time at the department.

00:43:38.317 --> 00:43:40.679
I came across this one footnote of yours,

00:43:40.679 --> 00:43:43.332
which I think kind of sums it all up.

00:43:43.332 --> 00:43:47.517
You said that you found
a note, a reminder.

00:43:47.517 --> 00:43:51.925
You were talking about how
presidents can compartmentalize

00:43:51.925 --> 00:43:53.804
and you said you came across,

00:43:53.804 --> 00:43:57.971
"A note of my reminders to
myself dated January 28th, 1998.

00:43:59.824 --> 00:44:02.420
"Call Senator Helms, call King Hussein,

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.481
"call Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,

00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:05.833
"make other congressional calls,

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:09.455
"prepare for China meeting,
buy non-fat yogurt."

00:44:09.455 --> 00:44:10.288
- Right.

00:44:11.745 --> 00:44:13.220
- You were juggling a lot of things.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.492
- I'll tell you what was interesting.

00:44:15.492 --> 00:44:18.159
When I was ambassador of the UN,

00:44:20.169 --> 00:44:22.235
I had lived on Long Island.

00:44:22.235 --> 00:44:25.047
I had always thought that I
would like to live in Manhattan

00:44:25.047 --> 00:44:27.288
under the right circumstances.

00:44:27.288 --> 00:44:31.649
The apartment is the
penthouse of the Waldorf.

00:44:31.649 --> 00:44:33.505
Actually, it's a hotel.

00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:37.132
One of the things that we
were trying to do at the time,

00:44:37.132 --> 00:44:38.735
there is no residents.

00:44:38.735 --> 00:44:42.268
Congress wanted to know why
we were paying so much rent

00:44:42.268 --> 00:44:44.804
at the hotel, and we'd say,

00:44:44.804 --> 00:44:45.791
"Well, it is a hotel."

00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:48.492
You get all the soaps, and
they come make your bed,

00:44:48.492 --> 00:44:49.575
and all that.

00:44:50.544 --> 00:44:52.903
I had a chef and a driver.

00:44:52.903 --> 00:44:55.853
Then I go back to my house in Washington,

00:44:55.853 --> 00:44:58.103
where I'd lived since 1968.

00:44:59.258 --> 00:45:00.475
I did have security.

00:45:00.475 --> 00:45:04.642
They all moved into my garage,
but I needed to buy yogurt.

00:45:06.096 --> 00:45:09.348
So I had to deal with
those particular issues,

00:45:09.348 --> 00:45:11.084
and I did have a family.

00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:13.008
My kids were grown up.

00:45:13.008 --> 00:45:14.993
One of the parts that
was kind of fun actually,

00:45:14.993 --> 00:45:18.304
my Dartmouth daughter took over my life.

00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:20.613
She would pay bills and things.

00:45:20.613 --> 00:45:22.687
We completely reversed positions.

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:24.673
She'd call me up and she'd say,

00:45:24.673 --> 00:45:26.824
"I just have your credit card here.

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:31.728
"Do you actually need
those other pair of shoes?"

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:34.156
Then, as we all worry, one of the things

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:38.323
when I was in Croatia, and
I went into this market

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.527
in Vukovar and they stoned us.

00:45:43.527 --> 00:45:45.254
They started throwing stones at me

00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:48.511
and one of the problems of
actually understanding Serbian,

00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:49.977
I could hear what they were saying,

00:45:49.977 --> 00:45:52.823
and they were saying, "Kurva,
kurva," which means whore.

00:45:52.823 --> 00:45:55.938
I said to the security people,
"We need to get out of here."

00:45:55.938 --> 00:46:00.432
So CNN covered a story,
carried a story that said,

00:46:00.432 --> 00:46:02.849
"Albright stoned in Vukovar."

00:46:04.179 --> 00:46:05.935
(laughter)

00:46:05.935 --> 00:46:09.993
My daughter calls me,
called the operations center

00:46:09.993 --> 00:46:11.553
at the State Department and said,

00:46:11.553 --> 00:46:14.354
"Have you heard from my
mother," and they said no.

00:46:14.354 --> 00:46:15.923
I got home and she said,

00:46:15.923 --> 00:46:18.165
"What are you doing going
to dangerous places?

00:46:18.165 --> 00:46:19.278
"You can't go to places

00:46:19.278 --> 00:46:21.369
"Without telling us what you're doing."

00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:23.533
There was that reversal,
and I've gotta say

00:46:23.533 --> 00:46:26.975
that my kids and my grandkids
are the ones that kept me

00:46:26.975 --> 00:46:30.707
as a completely human
being through all of it.

00:46:30.707 --> 00:46:31.957
- That's great.

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.627
We should probably come back

00:46:39.627 --> 00:46:42.294
to a slightly more somber issue,

00:46:43.654 --> 00:46:45.310
and that is, as you know,

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:49.220
today we are one day
after the 20th anniversary

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.803
of the beginning of
the genocide in Rwanda.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:59.134
This is something that you
have spoken about a great deal,

00:46:59.134 --> 00:47:02.158
and I believe everyone
who was in that first term

00:47:02.158 --> 00:47:06.061
of the Clinton
administration feels burdened

00:47:06.061 --> 00:47:10.349
and troubled by what
happened then and there.

00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:14.549
I am curious to know if, at
this particular milestone,

00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:18.390
you have any more thoughts
about it and as we face a

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.890
particularly impossible challenge in Syria

00:47:23.661 --> 00:47:27.727
where the killing goes on,
what we might be considering

00:47:27.727 --> 00:47:31.144
to improve our reaction to these kinds of

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:34.892
humanitarian crises?

00:47:34.892 --> 00:47:37.821
- It is clearly something
that has been on all our minds

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.474
and it's certainly something
that President Clinton

00:47:40.474 --> 00:47:42.276
has over and over again asked for,

00:47:42.276 --> 00:47:44.969
how did this happen, why did it happen,

00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:48.760
and trying to figure out what went wrong.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.424
I talk about it fairly frequently.

00:47:51.424 --> 00:47:53.822
One of the things, 'cause I do teach this

00:47:53.822 --> 00:47:57.572
decision-making course and you know this

00:47:57.572 --> 00:48:00.069
from your own experience, which is that

00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:01.902
hindsight is terrific.

00:48:03.049 --> 00:48:05.822
There's a lot of information
that comes out afterwards,

00:48:05.822 --> 00:48:07.526
but at the time, you
have to make decisions

00:48:07.526 --> 00:48:11.250
on the basis of the
information that you have.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.829
People may not believe this.

00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:14.702
I just tell you it's a statement of fact

00:48:14.702 --> 00:48:17.260
'cause I went back over
intelligence and things.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.400
We didn't know everything that we now know

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.987
about what happened in Rwanda.

00:48:21.987 --> 00:48:26.154
In fact, the information is
what I call volcanic genocide

00:48:30.947 --> 00:48:34.842
because the airplane of the
Hutu president was shot down

00:48:34.842 --> 00:48:38.759
and all of a sudden, this
happened very quickly.

00:48:38.759 --> 00:48:42.286
I spent a lot of time arguing
about my instructions.

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:45.367
I won't go through all that,
but what we're watching now

00:48:45.367 --> 00:48:48.425
is rolling genocide in a
number of different places.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:52.255
I have spent a lot of time
looking at all of this.

00:48:52.255 --> 00:48:56.369
We all have our stories and
I am a child of World War II.

00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:59.103
One could make the argument
that people didn't know

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:01.291
what was happening during World War II.

00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:03.929
In the Balkans, we
began to get information

00:49:03.929 --> 00:49:07.300
on what was happening and
there are a lot of reasons

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.166
that I thought we needed to
do something in the Balkans,

00:49:10.166 --> 00:49:12.915
but it was because we saw on CNN

00:49:12.915 --> 00:49:16.115
that people were being raped and murdered

00:49:16.115 --> 00:49:20.024
for being whatever ethnic group they were.

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:24.038
I have tried to keep with this
issue for a very long time

00:49:24.038 --> 00:49:28.205
and did a task force under
the auspices of US Institute

00:49:30.641 --> 00:49:34.932
for Peace and the Holocaust
Museum on genocide prevention,

00:49:34.932 --> 00:49:37.471
trying to figure out how
you get the information

00:49:37.471 --> 00:49:40.931
ahead of time, and very
rarely does a task force

00:49:40.931 --> 00:49:44.395
produce any results, but what
happened was we suggested

00:49:44.395 --> 00:49:47.496
that there be an
Atrocities Prevention Board

00:49:47.496 --> 00:49:49.331
within the NSC system.

00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:52.670
Because Samantha Power was
there as an individual,

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:53.950
it does exist.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.887
President Obama made it happen.

00:49:55.887 --> 00:49:57.999
Then there was the next piece to it.

00:49:57.999 --> 00:50:01.374
I was asked to coach our task
force on what is now known

00:50:01.374 --> 00:50:03.743
as the Responsibility to Protect,

00:50:03.743 --> 00:50:05.280
which makes life very different.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.056
If you know that something is happening,

00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:11.296
does the international community
have some responsibility

00:50:11.296 --> 00:50:13.163
to do something about it?

00:50:13.163 --> 00:50:16.851
It's a General Assembly resolution
that has been out there.

00:50:16.851 --> 00:50:19.018
The Libya Mandate was done

00:50:20.767 --> 00:50:24.213
with the Responsibility to Protect in it.

00:50:24.213 --> 00:50:27.171
The question is then, who carries it out

00:50:27.171 --> 00:50:29.664
and what happens if ...

00:50:29.664 --> 00:50:32.208
There's a real question
as to whether Libya hurt

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:34.842
or helped the Responsibility to Protect.

00:50:34.842 --> 00:50:37.588
There's the judgment that it
hurt because to some extent,

00:50:37.588 --> 00:50:40.105
it went beyond protecting civilians

00:50:40.105 --> 00:50:41.902
to regime change.

00:50:41.902 --> 00:50:43.305
The question is now Syria.

00:50:43.305 --> 00:50:47.598
There is no question that
people are being barrel bombed

00:50:47.598 --> 00:50:51.788
and starvation is being
used as a weapon of war.

00:50:51.788 --> 00:50:54.703
I happen to think that
there is this Responsibility

00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:58.046
to Protect, but the question
is, who carries it out

00:50:58.046 --> 00:51:00.345
and what are the issues if, in fact,

00:51:00.345 --> 00:51:03.565
there is no no-fly zone
or how do you provide

00:51:03.565 --> 00:51:05.694
the humanitarian assistance?

00:51:05.694 --> 00:51:08.194
I think we're slowly learning.

00:51:09.548 --> 00:51:14.484
I was asked this question
yesterday in Washington.

00:51:14.484 --> 00:51:18.790
I know what I feel like
that we didn't do Rwanda.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:20.012
I know what it's like.

00:51:20.012 --> 00:51:22.603
I get asked it, President
Clinton gets asked it.

00:51:22.603 --> 00:51:26.185
We are going to be asked,
why didn't we do something

00:51:26.185 --> 00:51:30.271
about Syria, not 20 years
from now, but a year from now,

00:51:30.271 --> 00:51:34.426
and I do think that that
Responsibility to Protect exists.

00:51:34.426 --> 00:51:39.004
One of the things to go back
to the historical analogy,

00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:41.620
I finally, as a result
of writing Prague Winter,

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.369
understood some of the
decision-making process

00:51:44.369 --> 00:51:46.297
around Munich.

00:51:46.297 --> 00:51:49.357
Something that I never quite
understood was how tired

00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:52.393
the British and French
were from World War I.

00:51:52.393 --> 00:51:55.603
They had lost a whole
generation of young men,

00:51:55.603 --> 00:51:57.674
their budget was a
mess, and their military

00:51:57.674 --> 00:52:00.804
was decapitated in many ways.

00:52:00.804 --> 00:52:03.440
While I will always believe
that Neville Chamberlain

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.237
is one of the more odious
characters in history,

00:52:06.237 --> 00:52:08.422
I do understand, all of a sudden,

00:52:08.422 --> 00:52:10.641
why he wanted peace so much.

00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:13.739
What he said about the
country that I was born in,

00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:16.741
"Why should we care about
people in far away places

00:52:16.741 --> 00:52:19.031
"with unpronounceable names?"

00:52:19.031 --> 00:52:23.075
The question is, we are tired
from Afghanistan and Iraq,

00:52:23.075 --> 00:52:25.060
our budget is a mess, there are questions

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:28.673
about our military, so
we have to ask ourselves,

00:52:28.673 --> 00:52:31.275
do we care about people in faraway places

00:52:31.275 --> 00:52:34.130
with unpronounceable
names and will we be sorry

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:38.373
if we don't actually
do something about it?

00:52:38.373 --> 00:52:41.679
- You mentioned Congress before.

00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:45.864
For a moment, I was thinking
of the first question

00:52:45.864 --> 00:52:49.947
that I would ask you today,
was is it really like

00:52:52.308 --> 00:52:53.232
in House of Cards?

00:52:53.232 --> 00:52:55.065
Is it really that bad?

00:52:56.749 --> 00:53:00.582
This is a broader question
about polarization.

00:53:01.515 --> 00:53:05.348
You manage to have a
good working relationship

00:53:06.854 --> 00:53:10.407
with a man whose nickname
was Senator No, Jesse Helms,

00:53:10.407 --> 00:53:12.663
who was really one of
the legendary figures

00:53:12.663 --> 00:53:15.221
in the history of the Senate and a man

00:53:15.221 --> 00:53:19.388
who was very, very challenging
to work with by all accounts.

00:53:21.359 --> 00:53:23.551
It doesn't seem like there's
even that kind of relationship

00:53:23.551 --> 00:53:26.218
across the aisle anywhere today.

00:53:27.161 --> 00:53:29.252
As someone who has watched Washington

00:53:29.252 --> 00:53:32.887
through administrations,
Republican and Democrat,

00:53:32.887 --> 00:53:34.604
I'm wondering what your reflections are

00:53:34.604 --> 00:53:38.015
on what we need to do
to get out of this mess.

00:53:38.015 --> 00:53:41.023
- I think it's not as
bad as House of Cards,

00:53:41.023 --> 00:53:44.896
but I think it is essential
to have that relationship,

00:53:44.896 --> 00:53:47.156
and I learned that from Ed Muskie.

00:53:47.156 --> 00:53:51.465
Ed Muskie became the first
Chairman of the Budget Committee.

00:53:51.465 --> 00:53:53.216
The question was how to make it work

00:53:53.216 --> 00:53:55.781
and he told all of us that worked for him,

00:53:55.781 --> 00:53:58.022
"You have to work with
Senator Henry Bellmon,"

00:53:58.022 --> 00:54:01.199
who was the ranking member
Republican from Oklahoma.

00:54:01.199 --> 00:54:02.944
There were a lot of relationships

00:54:02.944 --> 00:54:05.718
that went across the aisle.

00:54:05.718 --> 00:54:09.320
We worked with Senator Dole,
a number of different people.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.400
My Helms relationship
solidified that in my head,

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.418
and I'll tell you how that happened.

00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:18.193
I had just been made ambassador
to the United Nations

00:54:18.193 --> 00:54:22.461
and I get this phone call
from Senator Helms himself.

00:54:22.461 --> 00:54:24.854
There was a women's college
in Raleigh and he said,

00:54:24.854 --> 00:54:26.817
"You have been invited to come and speak

00:54:26.817 --> 00:54:30.457
"at the Bicentennial Anniversary
at this women's college,

00:54:30.457 --> 00:54:31.614
"and would you do it?"

00:54:31.614 --> 00:54:33.832
I thought I could get out of it by saying,

00:54:33.832 --> 00:54:37.492
"Sure, I'll do it, but
if you come with me."

00:54:37.492 --> 00:54:41.054
So I get this call back a
half an hour later, he said

00:54:41.054 --> 00:54:44.471
"I've changed my schedule,
I'm going there with you."

00:54:44.471 --> 00:54:48.371
So we go there and when somebody
has invited you to speak

00:54:48.371 --> 00:54:50.670
and they introduce you, they usually,

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:54.319
you were really nice, but
they usually say nice things.

00:54:54.319 --> 00:54:55.170
They're not gonna say,

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:59.029
"This idiot woman has just shown up here."

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:01.761
He introduces me, I was
talking to students,

00:55:01.761 --> 00:55:04.235
they were asking me
questions about the UN,

00:55:04.235 --> 00:55:06.991
here's this man who hated the UN,

00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:08.670
and I was answering them.

00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:12.833
We flew back together and he
actually kept talking about it,

00:55:12.833 --> 00:55:16.900
he was very interested
in it, and all of that.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.748
Then what happens is he
calls me up and he said,

00:55:19.748 --> 00:55:23.956
"I want you to come to
my alma mater, Wingate."

00:55:23.956 --> 00:55:28.616
I go, we go by car from
Raleigh to this place,

00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:31.457
and we're looking for barbecue places,

00:55:31.457 --> 00:55:33.412
and we're in this car forever.

00:55:33.412 --> 00:55:36.610
We finally get there, and
he was basically bionic

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.543
in terms of having artificial hips.

00:55:38.543 --> 00:55:41.018
He couldn't move and had
to get out of the car.

00:55:41.018 --> 00:55:44.051
So I'm helping him out,
and I'm hanging onto him,

00:55:44.051 --> 00:55:45.936
and there are pictures,
and they all of a sudden

00:55:45.936 --> 00:55:48.519
start saying, "The odd couple."

00:55:50.456 --> 00:55:54.149
I managed to talk about the
Chemical Weapons Convention

00:55:54.149 --> 00:55:56.732
and the convention about women.

00:55:58.563 --> 00:56:00.586
He's sitting in the audience, I mean,

00:56:00.586 --> 00:56:02.110
sitting with me on the stage,

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.297
and we keep talking about
more and more things.

00:56:04.297 --> 00:56:06.866
Then I'm named Secretary of State

00:56:06.866 --> 00:56:10.278
and I go to talk to
him about confirmation.

00:56:10.278 --> 00:56:14.800
He said, "Miss Madeleine, we
will make history together."

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.006
If you look at my hearings with him,

00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:20.613
they're all on tape, he's winking at me

00:56:20.613 --> 00:56:23.855
and being very, very friendly.

00:56:23.855 --> 00:56:25.584
We were talking about NATO expansion.

00:56:25.584 --> 00:56:27.688
It wouldn't have happened without him.

00:56:27.688 --> 00:56:31.100
I do think, despite the
fact that we disagreed

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.187
on very basic aspects
of America, ultimately,

00:56:35.187 --> 00:56:37.162
we were able to work together.

00:56:37.162 --> 00:56:40.478
I think it makes a difference
and I am very troubled

00:56:40.478 --> 00:56:42.251
by what is going on now.

00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:44.501
I love the American system.

00:56:47.706 --> 00:56:48.863
I worked with Congress

00:56:48.863 --> 00:56:52.495
when I was on the
National Security Council.

00:56:52.495 --> 00:56:53.745
I am Chairman of the Board

00:56:53.745 --> 00:56:55.781
of the National Democratic Institute,

00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:58.574
which talks about the nuts
and bolts of democracy.

00:56:58.574 --> 00:57:00.600
We're all over the place.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.407
We were somewhere and I say,

00:57:02.407 --> 00:57:05.549
"The essence of democracy is the existence

00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:08.862
"of an opposition party because, in fact,

00:57:08.862 --> 00:57:11.015
"it allows a choice to the voters

00:57:11.015 --> 00:57:13.157
"and accountability to the government,

00:57:13.157 --> 00:57:15.209
"and it's important to compromise."

00:57:15.209 --> 00:57:17.050
Then they say to us, whatever country,

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.881
"Yeah, like you guys now?"

00:57:18.881 --> 00:57:21.496
So we are a very bad
model for our own system.

00:57:21.496 --> 00:57:23.450
I do think it's essential,

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:27.146
and I think we all need to work on it.

00:57:27.146 --> 00:57:29.762
I actually have a lot
of Republican friends,

00:57:29.762 --> 00:57:33.269
and the kind that I have
kind of feel out of it

00:57:33.269 --> 00:57:36.150
in terms of some of the
things that are happening.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:39.150
There's the center that
needs to be worked on.

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.419
Part of the problem that has happened

00:57:41.419 --> 00:57:43.916
in terms of some of the
international issues,

00:57:43.916 --> 00:57:47.489
the far left and the far right
have met on the other side

00:57:47.489 --> 00:57:49.055
in terms of not getting involved

00:57:49.055 --> 00:57:50.805
in anything internationally.

00:57:50.805 --> 00:57:53.139
I think that is dangerous, obviously,

00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:55.483
the way that we've been discussing issues.

00:57:55.483 --> 00:57:58.559
So I would like to see more
Democrats in the center

00:57:58.559 --> 00:58:00.387
work with Republicans in the center

00:58:00.387 --> 00:58:02.924
to try to regain some civility

00:58:02.924 --> 00:58:05.220
and actually get something done.

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.470
(applause)

00:58:09.347 --> 00:58:13.180
I also have to say that
I find passing strange

00:58:15.455 --> 00:58:17.956
that people would wanna
be elected to Congress

00:58:17.956 --> 00:58:19.779
because they don't like government

00:58:19.779 --> 00:58:20.995
and don't wanna be there.

00:58:20.995 --> 00:58:23.495
Why do they wanna get elected?

00:58:24.537 --> 00:58:28.246
- I'm not sure anyone
here can answer that one.

00:58:28.246 --> 00:58:29.979
I just wanna ask one last question

00:58:29.979 --> 00:58:32.170
and then we'll turn it
over to the audience,

00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:34.486
which I'm sure will have many more

00:58:34.486 --> 00:58:37.413
interesting questions than I have.

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.772
Diplomacy is about sending signals

00:58:39.772 --> 00:58:43.189
and you innovated a new kind of signaling

00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:47.332
that had to do with jewelry.

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:53.410
I know that you've written a whole book

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:56.077
about signaling through jewelry.

00:58:57.296 --> 00:59:00.298
My guess is that there are
courses at NYU and elsewhere

00:59:00.298 --> 00:59:03.778
that would love to have
you come talk about fashion

00:59:03.778 --> 00:59:07.036
and diplomacy, but tell us
about the brooch you're wearing

00:59:07.036 --> 00:59:11.025
and perhaps about some of the other hints

00:59:11.025 --> 00:59:13.187
that you have used to send messages.

00:59:13.187 --> 00:59:14.616
- Well, I'll tell you how it got started.

00:59:14.616 --> 00:59:17.608
When I got to the UN,
it was in February '93

00:59:17.608 --> 00:59:19.392
and the Gulf War had just ended

00:59:19.392 --> 00:59:21.477
and the cease fire had been translated

00:59:21.477 --> 00:59:24.286
into a series of sanctions resolutions.

00:59:24.286 --> 00:59:26.505
I was an instructive ambassador,

00:59:26.505 --> 00:59:29.507
which meant that we had
to keep the sanctions on

00:59:29.507 --> 00:59:32.535
and my instructions were to
say perfectly terrible things

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:35.782
about Saddam Hussein
constantly, which he deserved.

00:59:35.782 --> 00:59:36.829
He invaded Kuwait.

00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:38.350
So we went at this a long time.

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:40.839
Finally, there's a poem
that appeared in the papers

00:59:40.839 --> 00:59:43.144
in Baghdad comparing me to many things,

00:59:43.144 --> 00:59:46.383
but among them, "an unparalleled serpent."

00:59:46.383 --> 00:59:48.819
I had a snake pin so I decided to wear it

00:59:48.819 --> 00:59:52.079
when we were talking about Iraq.

00:59:52.079 --> 00:59:53.836
You've seen when the ambassadors come out

00:59:53.836 --> 00:59:57.325
and talk to the press after the meetings.

00:59:57.325 --> 00:59:59.382
All of a sudden, the
camera zeroes in and says,

00:59:59.382 --> 01:00:01.257
"Why are you wearing that snake pin?"

01:00:01.257 --> 01:00:02.620
I said, "Because Saddam Hussein

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:04.826
"compared me to an unparalleled serpent."

01:00:04.826 --> 01:00:06.644
I thought, "Well, this is fun."

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.485
(laughter)

01:00:08.485 --> 01:00:10.759
So I went out and I bought
a lot of costume jewelry

01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:13.078
according to what I
thought we were gonna do

01:00:13.078 --> 01:00:14.495
on any given day.

01:00:15.384 --> 01:00:18.387
On good days, I wore flowers
and butterflies and balloons

01:00:18.387 --> 01:00:21.554
and on bad days, insects in a variety.

01:00:22.661 --> 01:00:23.994
The other ambassadors would say,

01:00:23.994 --> 01:00:25.787
"What are we gonna do today?"

01:00:25.787 --> 01:00:28.176
As you remember, first
President Bush had said,

01:00:28.176 --> 01:00:30.375
"Read my lips, no new taxes."

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:34.174
I said, "Read my pins,"
and that is how it started.

01:00:34.174 --> 01:00:37.523
Then there are lots of
stories that I have with them,

01:00:37.523 --> 01:00:41.109
but there are times that the pins ...

01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:42.698
This pin, let me tell you about,

01:00:42.698 --> 01:00:45.086
was given to me by General Shalikashvili,

01:00:45.086 --> 01:00:46.028
my great friend.

01:00:46.028 --> 01:00:47.725
He'd be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

01:00:47.725 --> 01:00:51.206
It's actually called America
and the pearls signify

01:00:51.206 --> 01:00:52.843
the aspects of America,

01:00:52.843 --> 01:00:56.173
justice, freedom, prosperity, liberty.

01:00:56.173 --> 01:00:58.423
I thought it was a good thing to wear.

01:00:58.423 --> 01:01:00.750
Pins have gotten me into trouble

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.285
and they've gotten me out of trouble.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.676
What happened, you've seen this picture,

01:01:05.676 --> 01:01:09.031
when we were doing the
50th anniversary of NATO.

01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:11.189
What happened was that President Clinton

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.440
and Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen and I

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.713
were sitting on a sofa, three of us.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:18.080
I don't know who started it,
but we did the hear no evil,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.390
see no, speak no evil monkeys.

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:24.557
It was in Time Magazine, we
looked like crazy people.

01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:28.972
I was somewhere and they
had three monkey pins

01:01:28.972 --> 01:01:30.775
so I bought 'em.

01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:34.942
We went to Russia for our
summit in the summer of 2000

01:01:36.688 --> 01:01:38.581
and I wore the monkey pins.

01:01:38.581 --> 01:01:40.420
We're walking in and President Putin

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.120
turns to President Clinton and says,

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.926
"We always notice what pins
Secretary Albright wears.

01:01:45.926 --> 01:01:47.483
"Why are you wearing those monkeys?"

01:01:47.483 --> 01:01:50.563
I actually said the
following thing, which is,

01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:53.987
"Because I think your
Chechnya policy is evil."

01:01:53.987 --> 01:01:55.617
President Clinton looks at me like,

01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:57.700
"Have you lost your mind?

01:01:58.565 --> 01:01:59.871
"You are the chief diplomat,

01:01:59.871 --> 01:02:01.840
"you have just screwed up the summit,"

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.930
Putin was furious.

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:04.686
Anyway, so that was that.

01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:07.331
That's when they got me into trouble.

01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:10.980
Then there was a time they
got me out of trouble.

01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.410
This is a little risque.

01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.638
What happened was I
actually invented the art

01:02:15.638 --> 01:02:17.239
of diplomatic kissing.

01:02:17.239 --> 01:02:21.096
You can't visualize Baker
or Kissinger going in,

01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:22.312
having a big embrace.

01:02:22.312 --> 01:02:26.259
Anyway, it's much more
complicated than meets the eye.

01:02:26.259 --> 01:02:28.104
The Latin, some kiss on the right cheek,

01:02:28.104 --> 01:02:31.081
some on the left cheek, a lot bump noses.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.749
Then the French kiss twice,
the Dutch kiss three times.

01:02:33.749 --> 01:02:35.486
Then there was Yasser Arafat.

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:37.756
- [Daniel] Just kept on kissing, yeah.

01:02:37.756 --> 01:02:42.581
- So I arrive in South
Korea one time, big embrace,

01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:44.476
we have a great meeting,
and all of a sudden,

01:02:44.476 --> 01:02:47.664
I get a phone call when
it's over, I'm back home,

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.696
from a journalist who says,

01:02:49.696 --> 01:02:52.371
"Don't you think that the
Korean foreign minister

01:02:52.371 --> 01:02:55.549
"should be fired about
what he said about you?"

01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:57.058
I said, "Well, what did he say?"

01:02:57.058 --> 01:02:58.409
He said, "I really like it

01:02:58.409 --> 01:03:00.282
"When Secretary Albright comes here.

01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:03.207
"We're the same age, but
I'm this tired old man,

01:03:03.207 --> 01:03:06.216
"and when I embrace her,
she has very firm breasts."

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:08.447
"So what do you have to say about that?"

01:03:08.447 --> 01:03:09.300
I said,

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:11.802
"Well, I have to have something
to put those pins on."

01:03:11.802 --> 01:03:14.088
(laughter)

01:03:14.088 --> 01:03:16.338
(applause)

01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:26.634
- Okay, well you took
the wind out of my sails.

01:03:26.634 --> 01:03:30.325
I can only say that having mastered

01:03:30.325 --> 01:03:32.830
diplomacy policy politics,

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:35.663
stand up is the obvious next step.

01:03:37.527 --> 01:03:40.574
With that, how about
we have some questions

01:03:40.574 --> 01:03:42.074
from the audience?

01:03:43.262 --> 01:03:47.095
I just want to insure,
please state your name.

01:03:48.183 --> 01:03:49.034
That's one rule.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.506
The other rule is please
have a question mark

01:03:50.506 --> 01:03:54.740
at the end of the
question, no perorations,

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:58.085
no declamations, that
would be great, thank you.

01:03:58.085 --> 01:03:59.988
Can we start over here?

01:03:59.988 --> 01:04:01.468
- [Woman] Thank you very much.

01:04:01.468 --> 01:04:04.075
What actions would you
actually like to see the US

01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:07.174
take in Syria or regards
to Syria and do you think

01:04:07.174 --> 01:04:11.011
that those are actually
feasibly going to happen, ever?

01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:13.835
- I would like to see
some kind of additional

01:04:13.835 --> 01:04:15.523
humanitarian assistance.

01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:18.978
The United States has done
quite a lot, I have to say.

01:04:18.978 --> 01:04:22.163
The question is how to work out a way

01:04:22.163 --> 01:04:24.830
to get more assistance in there,

01:04:28.953 --> 01:04:31.061
and I'm not sure this can happen,

01:04:31.061 --> 01:04:34.089
in terms of some kind
of military protection,

01:04:34.089 --> 01:04:36.399
not necessarily by the United States,

01:04:36.399 --> 01:04:39.163
but in a way that food
really could be delivered

01:04:39.163 --> 01:04:41.283
and also medicines.

01:04:41.283 --> 01:04:43.692
One of the things that
we're seeing, for instance,

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:46.847
we have thought polio has been eradicated.

01:04:46.847 --> 01:04:48.973
It has come back in a variety of places.

01:04:48.973 --> 01:04:51.647
Syria is one of them, and
it has spread to a number

01:04:51.647 --> 01:04:52.857
of other places.

01:04:52.857 --> 01:04:55.778
I think that we need to
somehow get in there.

01:04:55.778 --> 01:04:58.788
I know there are discussions
about a no-fly zone.

01:04:58.788 --> 01:05:00.851
I think that's very difficult

01:05:00.851 --> 01:05:03.742
and then I think that some
of the diplomatic activities

01:05:03.742 --> 01:05:06.677
in terms of trying to get
a transition government,

01:05:06.677 --> 01:05:08.010
it is essential.

01:05:09.448 --> 01:05:11.429
I do think that we need to get some

01:05:11.429 --> 01:05:13.789
additional assistance in there,

01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:16.177
try to figure out a
protected way to get it in,

01:05:16.177 --> 01:05:19.405
but not just by the United States.

01:05:19.405 --> 01:05:20.531
- [Woman] Thank you.

01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:22.936
- [Woman] Hi, so shortly after
you were Secretary of State,

01:05:22.936 --> 01:05:25.742
the terrorist attacks happened,
and I was just wondering

01:05:25.742 --> 01:05:27.673
how much Afghanistan was on the radar

01:05:27.673 --> 01:05:30.065
when you were Secretary of State

01:05:30.065 --> 01:05:31.950
and what you tried to do with Al Qaeda

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:35.824
and other terrorist
organizations in that region.

01:05:35.824 --> 01:05:39.548
- First of all, (clears throat) excuse me.

01:05:39.548 --> 01:05:42.272
Al Qaeda was very much on the scene

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:45.478
and something (clears throat) excuse me.

01:05:45.478 --> 01:05:48.953
One of the things that
had happened very early on

01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:53.039
in '93, when there was
initial terrorist attack

01:05:53.039 --> 01:05:56.947
or an attempt on the World Trade Center,

01:05:56.947 --> 01:05:59.078
also threats at the United Nations,

01:05:59.078 --> 01:06:01.377
this is something that we
actually worked on together

01:06:01.377 --> 01:06:04.476
in terms of trying to
figure out what happened,

01:06:04.476 --> 01:06:05.837
who had done it.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:09.988
We did know that various
elements of Al Qaeda

01:06:09.988 --> 01:06:13.091
and Osama Bin Laden were
behind a lot of the aspects,

01:06:13.091 --> 01:06:15.930
that he had spent some time in Sudan,

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.470
and then there were the embassy attacks,

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.453
which is a whole other issue

01:06:20.453 --> 01:06:23.105
in terms of how we responded to that.

01:06:23.105 --> 01:06:26.572
The other part though, on
Afghanistan that was going on,

01:06:26.572 --> 01:06:29.822
was, I think in many ways, Afghanistan,

01:06:31.226 --> 01:06:34.171
everything that happened
after the Soviet invasion

01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:35.956
and the Soviets were pushed out,

01:06:35.956 --> 01:06:38.538
was lack of attention
by the United States.

01:06:38.538 --> 01:06:40.407
We just left.

01:06:40.407 --> 01:06:43.860
The Taliban, in many ways, was created,

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:48.054
some by the Pakistanis, in
terms of creating law and order.

01:06:48.054 --> 01:06:50.286
What we were trying to
do when we were in office

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:53.536
was trying to figure out how to support

01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:57.339
and who to support in Afghanistan.

01:06:57.339 --> 01:07:00.579
It was very much on our radar.

01:07:00.579 --> 01:07:03.785
I went a number of times to refugee camps.

01:07:03.785 --> 01:07:07.426
One of the issues was we didn't
wanna recognize the Taliban

01:07:07.426 --> 01:07:10.119
because of their treatment of women.

01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:12.536
So there was never neverland.

01:07:13.457 --> 01:07:16.285
We were trying to get
then, when Osama Bin Laden

01:07:16.285 --> 01:07:19.818
went to Afghanistan, to get
the Pakistanis to help us

01:07:19.818 --> 01:07:21.025
get him out.

01:07:21.025 --> 01:07:22.850
That wasn't happening.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.933
It was very much on our radar screen.

01:07:27.806 --> 01:07:30.994
By the way, one of the
things that was going on,

01:07:30.994 --> 01:07:35.022
we spent an awful lot of
time dealing with issues

01:07:35.022 --> 01:07:36.772
to do with terrorism.

01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:41.752
President Clinton, you were
involved in all of this

01:07:41.752 --> 01:07:44.564
in terms of creating
counter terrorism centers,

01:07:44.564 --> 01:07:45.897
a number of different ways.

01:07:45.897 --> 01:07:49.883
There was a whole part that
was tracking Osama Bin Laden.

01:07:49.883 --> 01:07:53.088
We were working on it
in all kinds of ways.

01:07:53.088 --> 01:07:56.306
One of the interesting
periods in American history

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:59.819
or politics is the transition period.

01:07:59.819 --> 01:08:03.449
Both Sandy Berger and
I reaped our successors

01:08:03.449 --> 01:08:05.700
about the threat of terrorism.

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.839
There was no principals
meeting to discuss terrorism

01:08:08.839 --> 01:08:12.133
until after 9/11 and
there was a real question

01:08:12.133 --> 01:08:15.097
as to how seriously it
was taken, but believe me,

01:08:15.097 --> 01:08:19.264
we spent a lot of time on
Afghanistan and on terrorism.

01:08:21.133 --> 01:08:22.476
- [Daniel] Okay, over here.

01:08:22.476 --> 01:08:23.743
- [Man] Thank you again for coming.

01:08:23.743 --> 01:08:26.062
My question is more about eastern Europe.

01:08:26.062 --> 01:08:27.651
I studied abroad in Prague last year

01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:29.743
and I talked to a lot of people
about how they were nervous

01:08:29.743 --> 01:08:32.111
about our surge in Russia
and I'm sure those feelings

01:08:32.111 --> 01:08:34.568
have only grown stronger since then.

01:08:34.568 --> 01:08:36.343
With most of these countries
in eastern Europe now,

01:08:36.343 --> 01:08:38.878
part of NATO, the Baltic
countries, the Czech Republic

01:08:38.878 --> 01:08:43.289
and so on, if Russia were
to move into look to protect

01:08:43.289 --> 01:08:46.204
the Russian minorities in
Estonia, in the Baltic states,

01:08:46.204 --> 01:08:50.102
would one of those states
evoke section five of NATO

01:08:50.102 --> 01:08:51.631
or the prospects of that?

01:08:51.631 --> 01:08:53.534
How do you see eastern European countries

01:08:53.534 --> 01:08:56.307
reacting to Russia in their backyards?

01:08:56.307 --> 01:08:59.932
- Article 5 is central to the NATO treaty.

01:08:59.932 --> 01:09:03.943
What it says is an attack
on one is an attack on all.

01:09:03.943 --> 01:09:05.956
One of the issues that
we were dealing with

01:09:05.956 --> 01:09:10.325
when we were looking over the
new strategic concept at all

01:09:10.325 --> 01:09:13.436
was hos relevant Article
5 continued to be.

01:09:13.436 --> 01:09:14.927
Everybody signed up for it.

01:09:14.927 --> 01:09:17.508
What was an interesting
question at that time

01:09:17.508 --> 01:09:21.267
was whether a cyber attack
was an Article 5 attack.

01:09:21.267 --> 01:09:25.001
The question was, were you
able to trace it or not?

01:09:25.001 --> 01:09:27.844
The question of Article 5 is out there.

01:09:27.844 --> 01:09:30.628
Article 5 has only been invoked once

01:09:30.628 --> 01:09:35.078
in the entire history,
which was after 9/11.

01:09:35.078 --> 01:09:38.578
The question is, if it were to be invoked,

01:09:40.052 --> 01:09:41.995
then in fact, there is a responsibility

01:09:41.995 --> 01:09:44.680
to do something about
it, and the question is,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.534
to what extent, what one would
do, who would carry it out?

01:09:49.534 --> 01:09:51.193
It's the threat of Article 5

01:09:51.193 --> 01:09:53.789
that I think is actually very important.

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.591
It has worked in a
number of different ways

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.746
in terms of deterrence.

01:09:57.746 --> 01:10:02.157
The problem is if one takes
what is happening now,

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:05.974
is there's not gonna be
some kind of a military ...

01:10:05.974 --> 01:10:08.067
Part of the way this has been happening

01:10:08.067 --> 01:10:10.022
is through provocations and things.

01:10:10.022 --> 01:10:12.772
It's hard to speak
about what might happen,

01:10:12.772 --> 01:10:15.300
but Article 5 is a real thing.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.976
One of the things that
is happening is NATO

01:10:17.976 --> 01:10:22.143
has set up a number of
exercises that are going on.

01:10:23.236 --> 01:10:25.524
There are airplanes that
are doing surveillance

01:10:25.524 --> 01:10:28.909
and NATO, Secretary General Rasmussen

01:10:28.909 --> 01:10:31.999
has really been fairly active on all this.

01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:35.817
When President Obama was in Brussels,

01:10:35.817 --> 01:10:37.269
this was a part of the discussion.

01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:41.453
We have an obligation, but the question is

01:10:41.453 --> 01:10:43.956
how the various parts of it would evolve.

01:10:43.956 --> 01:10:47.983
I think it has been an
important deterrent, frankly.

01:10:47.983 --> 01:10:50.006
- [Daniel] Over here, please.

01:10:50.006 --> 01:10:51.574
- [Man] One argument I've heard

01:10:51.574 --> 01:10:54.070
against the two-state solution is that

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:56.455
it would make it much more difficult

01:10:56.455 --> 01:10:58.028
for Israel to defend itself

01:10:58.028 --> 01:11:01.698
against future Palestinian aggression.

01:11:01.698 --> 01:11:03.544
Given that you're a supporter
of the two-state solution,

01:11:03.544 --> 01:11:05.615
how would you respond to that?

01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:07.541
- I don't agree with that.

01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:11.541
I think part of the issue
here is, first of all,

01:11:13.846 --> 01:11:18.187
Israel now, in fact many
ways, has walls all around,

01:11:18.187 --> 01:11:19.876
much larger.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:23.507
I think that there are
attacks going on now,

01:11:23.507 --> 01:11:27.674
and I think the question is
how you establish a system

01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:32.190
whereby the Palestinians
feel that they have

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.310
some buy-in to what is going on,

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:39.477
and that some of the hostility
and anger, I believe,

01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:43.774
would disappear and it
would make it harder

01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:47.912
to mobilize various groups
among the Palestinians

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:50.532
who are constantly into arguing

01:11:50.532 --> 01:11:52.876
that they don't have legitimate rights.

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:55.923
The question would be how
the two states are set up.

01:11:55.923 --> 01:11:59.167
One of the things that Secretary
Kerry has been involved in

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:00.792
and that he asked me to help on,

01:12:00.792 --> 01:12:02.666
we just had a meeting about this,

01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:07.024
in terms of trying to
figure out how to have a way

01:12:07.024 --> 01:12:10.321
that in a new state of Palestine,

01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:13.442
there would be some economic viability.

01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:15.993
Part of the problem is that
there's a whole generation

01:12:15.993 --> 01:12:18.335
of young people that don't have jobs.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:21.682
There needs to be in a Palestinian state,

01:12:21.682 --> 01:12:25.817
economic investment and
some validity and buy-in

01:12:25.817 --> 01:12:27.731
to having a different future.

01:12:27.731 --> 01:12:29.764
I have to tell you, when I was Secretary

01:12:29.764 --> 01:12:33.179
and I went on my first trip
as Secretary to Ramallah,

01:12:33.179 --> 01:12:35.606
I went to a school and a
young man there asked me,

01:12:35.606 --> 01:12:39.485
"What is my future," and I
couldn't answer the question.

01:12:39.485 --> 01:12:42.357
Therefore, I think that
part of what needs to happen

01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:46.017
is to get this youth cohort having jobs

01:12:46.017 --> 01:12:48.751
that has to come from a two-state solution

01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:53.065
and economic viability
of the Palestinian state.

01:12:53.065 --> 01:12:54.377
- [Daniel] Okay.

01:12:54.377 --> 01:12:55.582
- [Avena] Madame Secretary,

01:12:55.582 --> 01:12:57.247
it is such an honor to
hear from you today.

01:12:57.247 --> 01:12:58.851
My name is Avena Sedarius.

01:12:58.851 --> 01:13:00.132
I'm a Foreign Service Officer

01:13:00.132 --> 01:13:03.262
and I joined the Foreign
Service when you were Secretary.

01:13:03.262 --> 01:13:05.692
So working on my very first VIP visit

01:13:05.692 --> 01:13:08.590
was your visit to Thailand
for the ASEAN Summit

01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:11.851
and watching you sing with
Alex Downer, Mambo Number 5

01:13:11.851 --> 01:13:14.012
was my first foreign experience

01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:16.119
as a Foreign Service Officer.

01:13:16.119 --> 01:13:17.916
In light of what we remember then,

01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:20.396
your very groundbreaking
work in North Korea,

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.166
can you give us your thoughts
on the negotiations with Iran

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:26.184
on the nuclear file, and if it goes well,

01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:28.457
what should be the next issue we broach

01:13:28.457 --> 01:13:29.751
with the Iranians?

01:13:29.751 --> 01:13:32.501
Should it be containing the IRGC?

01:13:33.549 --> 01:13:37.279
Should it be their mucking,
how would you approach this?

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.146
- First of all, let me say various things

01:13:39.146 --> 01:13:41.455
that you never thought
you would have to do

01:13:41.455 --> 01:13:45.413
as Secretary of State would be to sing.

01:13:45.413 --> 01:13:47.746
- [Avena] And you were good.

01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.543
- I was told when I first
started that it's required

01:13:53.543 --> 01:13:55.372
at this last dinner at the ASEAN,

01:13:55.372 --> 01:13:58.116
every country puts on a
skit, and somebody said,

01:13:58.116 --> 01:14:01.116
"America does really badly, always."

01:14:02.114 --> 01:14:03.862
On the more serious question,

01:14:03.862 --> 01:14:08.029
I think that the talks are
going on right now in Vienna

01:14:10.096 --> 01:14:13.794
under Secretary Sherman,
who is there representing,

01:14:13.794 --> 01:14:18.232
although it says "senior
official," basically saying

01:14:18.232 --> 01:14:20.708
that they're hopeful in
terms of some of the things

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:23.648
that have been laid down at the moment.

01:14:23.648 --> 01:14:27.231
I think that there are viable options

01:14:27.231 --> 01:14:29.682
that are in the agreement.

01:14:29.682 --> 01:14:31.959
The real question is
the amount of enrichment

01:14:31.959 --> 01:14:36.073
the Iranians can undertake
and will they stop

01:14:36.073 --> 01:14:39.990
in terms of dismantling
their plans and things?

01:14:43.123 --> 01:14:45.332
I think it is worth pushing forward on it,

01:14:45.332 --> 01:14:47.846
but it all has to be verifiable.

01:14:47.846 --> 01:14:49.386
That is the problem.

01:14:49.386 --> 01:14:52.143
The issue is, you were
talking about one thing

01:14:52.143 --> 01:14:55.696
links to another, we
have a diplomatic issue

01:14:55.696 --> 01:14:57.403
at this very moment.

01:14:57.403 --> 01:15:00.975
The person that was named
to represent Iran at the UN

01:15:00.975 --> 01:15:04.883
was one of the hostage takers in 1979

01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.794
and we have just turned
down the visa application.

01:15:07.794 --> 01:15:11.307
The question is how that kind of thing

01:15:11.307 --> 01:15:14.474
then impacts the negotiator in Vienna.

01:15:16.368 --> 01:15:19.350
Also, one of the things
that we somehow forget

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:22.774
are the domestic politics of Iran.

01:15:22.774 --> 01:15:26.941
Rouhani is theoretically
immoderate how he operates

01:15:28.163 --> 01:15:32.206
within a difficult domestic environment

01:15:32.206 --> 01:15:35.456
and responds to this
and then does not look

01:15:35.456 --> 01:15:38.274
as though he's given
away the entire Iranian

01:15:38.274 --> 01:15:40.024
negotiating position.

01:15:40.926 --> 01:15:44.032
I think the United States and the P5+1

01:15:44.032 --> 01:15:46.632
are in a pretty good
position if we keep pushing

01:15:46.632 --> 01:15:49.197
and try to make sure that it's verifiable.

01:15:49.197 --> 01:15:53.194
It does have an effect,
also, on North Korea

01:15:53.194 --> 01:15:55.256
and North Korea, vice versa.

01:15:55.256 --> 01:15:58.612
I personally believe that
it is worth going forward

01:15:58.612 --> 01:16:02.076
with the Iranian talks, and pushing,

01:16:02.076 --> 01:16:05.638
and trying to figure out
how much space Rouhani

01:16:05.638 --> 01:16:07.805
really has and verifiable.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:12.112
The verifiable part is
the most important aspect,

01:16:12.112 --> 01:16:13.529
not to be fooled.

01:16:16.681 --> 01:16:17.974
- [Jesse] Good evening, Madame Secretary.

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:21.771
My name's Jesse Perez and I'm
in the masters in Liberal Arts

01:16:21.771 --> 01:16:24.362
studies program here at Dartmouth.

01:16:24.362 --> 01:16:26.379
My question for you, generally speaking,

01:16:26.379 --> 01:16:28.421
is what are your thoughts and insights

01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:31.950
in terms of American states craft,

01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:35.131
certainly because we are
a war-fatigued country,

01:16:35.131 --> 01:16:37.826
more militarized in the
character and nature

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:41.890
of our states craft, do you
think that over the past

01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:45.658
10 or 12 years, or 10 or 20 years at that,

01:16:45.658 --> 01:16:48.632
American foreign policy,
or the Department of Peace

01:16:48.632 --> 01:16:52.164
in this particular case, has lost pallor,

01:16:52.164 --> 01:16:55.570
relatively speaking, to
much of the conversations

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.853
that revolve around military issues?

01:16:58.853 --> 01:17:03.288
If so, how do you think it's
going to evolve over time?

01:17:03.288 --> 01:17:07.455
- I think that, as I said,
there's a variety of tools

01:17:08.716 --> 01:17:10.299
that are out there.

01:17:12.693 --> 01:17:16.860
Having used force when Clinton
administration was in office,

01:17:18.543 --> 01:17:22.837
ultimately after a great deal of diplomacy

01:17:22.837 --> 01:17:27.488
in terms of Bosnia and Kosovo
and not having it work,

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:31.655
then using the threat of
force, and then using diplomacy

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.482
to use force, and then using diplomacy

01:17:37.593 --> 01:17:41.187
when force was over, I think
you need that kind of mixture

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:45.680
but you don't try to use
force as your main tool.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.397
What I was really troubled by,

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:50.480
I do believe that the American model,

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.173
in terms of talking about our values

01:17:54.173 --> 01:17:57.965
and how we operate, is something
that is very important.

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:01.515
The United States is better
off when other countries

01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:04.426
are stable and I happen
to believe Democratic

01:18:04.426 --> 01:18:06.426
and have market systems.

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:11.575
That's why I basically
am an internationalist,

01:18:11.575 --> 01:18:15.117
but I'm worried about the
militarization of policy

01:18:15.117 --> 01:18:17.642
and especially worried, as I mentioned,

01:18:17.642 --> 01:18:19.331
because I am Chairman of the Board

01:18:19.331 --> 01:18:21.670
of the National Democratic Institute,

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:23.821
that with what happened in Iraq,

01:18:23.821 --> 01:18:25.904
it militarized democracy.

01:18:27.127 --> 01:18:29.591
I think it undermined the whole concept

01:18:29.591 --> 01:18:33.508
of how we are able to
put our values out there.

01:18:34.447 --> 01:18:36.726
I happen to believe that the United States

01:18:36.726 --> 01:18:38.526
is an exceptional nation,

01:18:38.526 --> 01:18:42.473
but I don't believe that
exceptions should be made for us.

01:18:42.473 --> 01:18:45.807
When we do things that
undermine that particular

01:18:45.807 --> 01:18:48.541
value system, I think it hurts us.

01:18:48.541 --> 01:18:52.004
The militarization of our
policy, I think, has hurt.

01:18:52.004 --> 01:18:54.878
It is one of the things
that President Obama,

01:18:54.878 --> 01:18:57.463
by making clear that he wanted to end Iraq

01:18:57.463 --> 01:19:00.056
and Afghanistan, is trying to make clear,

01:19:00.056 --> 01:19:02.374
that we don't have to pursue our policies

01:19:02.374 --> 01:19:04.874
through military means.

01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.335
I agree with you.

01:19:06.335 --> 01:19:10.171
I think the problem is,
to go back to my toolbox,

01:19:10.171 --> 01:19:13.338
there are not a lot of tools in there.

01:19:14.261 --> 01:19:16.268
This is why presidents say,

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:18.841
"All options are on the table,"

01:19:18.841 --> 01:19:22.128
but the bottom line is not the
first tool that you pick up,

01:19:22.128 --> 01:19:24.795
but there is this combination
of force and diplomacy.

01:19:24.795 --> 01:19:26.391
I've mentioned about the pin.

01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:28.327
General Shalikashvili gave it to me,

01:19:28.327 --> 01:19:31.810
and one of the times he
and I were standing outside

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:34.959
the Situation Room and
Secretary Ruben came by.

01:19:34.959 --> 01:19:37.325
He said, "Aha, force and diplomacy."

01:19:37.325 --> 01:19:40.837
Shali said, "Yeah, and which is which?"

01:19:40.837 --> 01:19:43.225
The bottom line is that the Pentagon

01:19:43.225 --> 01:19:45.344
and the State Department
have to figure out

01:19:45.344 --> 01:19:47.074
how to work together.

01:19:47.074 --> 01:19:50.084
You can't just eschew the use of force,

01:19:50.084 --> 01:19:53.367
but I prefer moving on
the diplomatic track

01:19:53.367 --> 01:19:55.784
with force in the background.

01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:59.160
(applause)

01:20:01.758 --> 01:20:03.468
- Can I follow that up quickly?

01:20:03.468 --> 01:20:06.842
You spent a lot of time in the 90s

01:20:06.842 --> 01:20:10.738
trying to restore funding
at the State Department.

01:20:10.738 --> 01:20:14.402
There were a lot of very painful cuts.

01:20:14.402 --> 01:20:16.603
You talked about the toolbox.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:18.083
When I look at the toolbox,

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:19.948
I always see a really big hammer

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.117
and maybe a really small pliers

01:20:22.117 --> 01:20:24.656
because we so underfund diplomacy.

01:20:24.656 --> 01:20:27.211
We're in a better place
than we used to be,

01:20:27.211 --> 01:20:29.378
but if you were president,

01:20:34.637 --> 01:20:36.864
would you like to see a State Department

01:20:36.864 --> 01:20:39.450
that had $10, $20, $30 billion more?

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:42.598
Ultimately, money is
the key diplomatic tool

01:20:42.598 --> 01:20:45.093
and I don't think people
always appreciate that.

01:20:45.093 --> 01:20:46.814
- I think people don't understand

01:20:46.814 --> 01:20:51.186
the relative size of one
budget verses the other.

01:20:51.186 --> 01:20:54.518
Even though the Defense
Department is under sequestration

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:57.808
in the Budget Control Act,
it has somewhere around

01:20:57.808 --> 01:21:01.315
$500 billion and the State Department,

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:05.519
in order to pay for the
services of the diplomats,

01:21:05.519 --> 01:21:07.589
and the buildings, and the programs,

01:21:07.589 --> 01:21:09.422
has about $50 billion.

01:21:10.695 --> 01:21:14.862
A lot of people on the issue
of foreign aid, for instance,

01:21:15.851 --> 01:21:19.453
I'm not sure not in this
audience, but other audiences,

01:21:19.453 --> 01:21:20.379
if you ask,

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:22.226
"How much do you think
goes to foreign aid,"

01:21:22.226 --> 01:21:25.601
people will say, "25% of the budget."

01:21:25.601 --> 01:21:26.451
You say,

01:21:26.451 --> 01:21:30.365
"No, but how much would you
really think it should be?"

01:21:30.365 --> 01:21:34.532
People say 10% and you
say, "It's less than 1%."

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.897
In many ways, a tool that
one needs when I talk about

01:21:39.897 --> 01:21:43.817
it's the economic assistance
in some form or another,

01:21:43.817 --> 01:21:46.591
it is a very important tool
and there's not a lot of money

01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:48.575
that goes to it.

01:21:48.575 --> 01:21:51.802
People think that
diplomats have fancy lives

01:21:51.802 --> 01:21:54.099
and go to a lot of parties,
but the bottom line is

01:21:54.099 --> 01:21:57.249
the security of our
buildings are important

01:21:57.249 --> 01:21:59.963
and then having foreign service officers

01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:04.088
and civil servants that
are able to do the work.

01:22:04.088 --> 01:22:07.391
It's disproportionate and I
think one could do a great deal.

01:22:07.391 --> 01:22:08.657
It's very hard to explain.

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.085
I have to say that going up to the hill

01:22:11.085 --> 01:22:13.215
and asking for foreign assistance,

01:22:13.215 --> 01:22:16.147
these are two words that
should never go together,

01:22:16.147 --> 01:22:18.061
it's like selling some disease.

01:22:18.061 --> 01:22:20.183
The bottom line is you have to say

01:22:20.183 --> 01:22:23.042
that this is good for
our national security.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.483
It definitely helps us to be able to have

01:22:25.483 --> 01:22:27.066
that kind of money.

01:22:28.837 --> 01:22:30.378
- [Woman] Do you think
the world has gotten

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:33.628
more or less peaceful during your life?

01:22:35.904 --> 01:22:37.937
- More or less peaceful?

01:22:37.937 --> 01:22:42.104
I wish, listening to your
voice, that I could say it has.

01:22:44.536 --> 01:22:47.585
In a strange way, there is no such thing,

01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:50.301
I don't believe in Cold
War nostalgia when,

01:22:50.301 --> 01:22:54.080
in fact, the US and the Soviet
Union were facing each other

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.374
with nuclear weapons
and when people like me

01:22:58.374 --> 01:23:02.648
were your age, we actually
practiced going under our desks

01:23:02.648 --> 01:23:05.547
and being afraid of a nuclear attack.

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:09.444
The bottom line is that
the world was dangerous

01:23:09.444 --> 01:23:11.194
but there were rules.

01:23:12.077 --> 01:23:16.244
They operated in a way that
people knew what was going on.

01:23:18.196 --> 01:23:21.286
Now what I think has happened
is there are an awful lot

01:23:21.286 --> 01:23:23.713
of factors out there
that are hard to control

01:23:23.713 --> 01:23:25.483
and figure out.

01:23:25.483 --> 01:23:27.751
A lot about the system doesn't work

01:23:27.751 --> 01:23:32.584
and an awful lot of people
are dying in a lot of places,

01:23:32.584 --> 01:23:35.885
some because their
neighbors don't like them

01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:39.228
or they are fighting over
borders or something.

01:23:39.228 --> 01:23:43.943
If one looks at the world,
it's not that peaceful.

01:23:43.943 --> 01:23:47.056
America is a very special place.

01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:50.825
We, I think, are blessed
by having neighbors

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.391
on both sides that are friendly

01:23:53.391 --> 01:23:55.789
and mostly oceans that protect us.

01:23:55.789 --> 01:23:59.115
The question is whether
people in the United States

01:23:59.115 --> 01:24:01.789
care whether other parts of the world

01:24:01.789 --> 01:24:05.831
are peaceful or not and
whether problems out there

01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:07.997
come home to America.

01:24:07.997 --> 01:24:10.936
You are gonna grow up in a
pretty tough neighborhood,

01:24:10.936 --> 01:24:13.887
not neighborhood as
much as the environment,

01:24:13.887 --> 01:24:16.829
and the rules aren't there yet.

01:24:16.829 --> 01:24:18.770
One hopes that there will be rules

01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:21.437
that will make it more peaceful.

01:24:23.372 --> 01:24:25.622
(applause)

01:24:30.664 --> 01:24:32.421
- [Man] First of all, thank you very much

01:24:32.421 --> 01:24:34.582
for sharing your wisdom with us.

01:24:34.582 --> 01:24:35.810
My question has something to do with

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:37.704
the US China relationship.

01:24:37.704 --> 01:24:40.340
I've heard that in recent years,

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:42.164
many Chinese people think that China

01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:45.322
should thank George W. Bush
and Vladimir Putin equally

01:24:45.322 --> 01:24:47.564
because the former
started the war on terror

01:24:47.564 --> 01:24:49.419
and the latter took over Crimea,

01:24:49.419 --> 01:24:51.932
both of which essentially
helped China to buy

01:24:51.932 --> 01:24:54.827
almost two more decades
of time to further rise

01:24:54.827 --> 01:24:57.077
economically and militarily

01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.024
when America was busy
dealing with other issues.

01:25:01.024 --> 01:25:02.475
I'm just wondering, my question is,

01:25:02.475 --> 01:25:04.261
how do you see the impact
of this kind of thinking

01:25:04.261 --> 01:25:06.689
on President Obama's
pivot back to Asia policy

01:25:06.689 --> 01:25:09.747
and the future of US China relationship?

01:25:09.747 --> 01:25:11.918
- I think that the US China relationship

01:25:11.918 --> 01:25:15.923
is the most important
relationship of the 21st century.

01:25:15.923 --> 01:25:20.256
It is a huge country
with a huge population

01:25:20.256 --> 01:25:23.423
and a system that is trying to reform.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.720
They are, you can decide,
either our competitors

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.843
or our partners.

01:25:30.843 --> 01:25:32.590
They're a little bit of both,

01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:36.491
but I think it is the major relationship.

01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:38.663
One of the things is the United States

01:25:38.663 --> 01:25:41.115
is an Atlantic and a Pacific power.

01:25:41.115 --> 01:25:43.584
I think it was very appropriate
when President Obama

01:25:43.584 --> 01:25:46.882
was talking about rebalancing.

01:25:46.882 --> 01:25:49.380
He is now going to go visit Asia.

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:52.745
He had a meeting with President Xi Jinping

01:25:52.745 --> 01:25:55.380
in terms of trying to develop
some kind of a new model

01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:57.738
of our relationship.

01:25:57.738 --> 01:26:01.823
I do think that the way you
stated it is interesting

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:06.057
in that we have been
absorbed with other things.

01:26:06.057 --> 01:26:09.393
There are real questions as to what lesson

01:26:09.393 --> 01:26:12.226
the Chinese will draw from Crimea.

01:26:13.192 --> 01:26:15.361
I've been reading some
articles where they think,

01:26:15.361 --> 01:26:16.528
"Aha, Taiwan."

01:26:17.925 --> 01:26:21.618
The bottom line is, what are the lessons?

01:26:21.618 --> 01:26:25.090
Part of the problem with
dealing with terrorism

01:26:25.090 --> 01:26:28.681
is that some countries
designate people as terrorists

01:26:28.681 --> 01:26:29.688
who really aren't.

01:26:29.688 --> 01:26:31.870
They are people who just object,

01:26:31.870 --> 01:26:34.352
like the Uyghurs or something.

01:26:34.352 --> 01:26:37.214
I think that the Chinese
are reading what is going on

01:26:37.214 --> 01:26:39.610
in a variety of places carefully,

01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:42.454
but basically, the US Chinese relationship

01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:44.783
is absolutely crucial.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:49.232
We are linked economically
in a number of ways,

01:26:49.232 --> 01:26:51.760
and also, we would like to see them

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.420
take a more responsible role globally

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.043
in order to manage some of the issues

01:26:56.043 --> 01:26:58.964
that young woman asked about,

01:26:58.964 --> 01:27:01.658
is how to realize that by cooperating,

01:27:01.658 --> 01:27:03.790
we can deal on some of the issues

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:05.093
in other parts of the world.

01:27:05.093 --> 01:27:06.987
It is, just flat out I would say,

01:27:06.987 --> 01:27:09.654
the most important relationship.

01:27:11.083 --> 01:27:12.595
- [Daniel] Good question. Okay.

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:14.173
- [Justin] Hi, my name is Justin Moffatt,

01:27:14.173 --> 01:27:17.591
and my question's in regard
to the diplomatic toolbox

01:27:17.591 --> 01:27:19.657
that you were talking about.

01:27:19.657 --> 01:27:21.418
What is the role, would you say,

01:27:21.418 --> 01:27:24.278
of using red lines as President Obama did

01:27:24.278 --> 01:27:26.446
most recently with the Syrian conflict

01:27:26.446 --> 01:27:29.499
and how that might change
how the United States

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.342
might be able to respond?

01:27:31.342 --> 01:27:33.651
Also, what is the role of Congress

01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:37.234
in regards to being
able to effectively act

01:27:38.876 --> 01:27:41.016
in a time sensitive situation,

01:27:41.016 --> 01:27:43.789
as we were this past summer?

01:27:43.789 --> 01:27:47.956
- Let me say, here I've been
talking for quite a long time

01:27:49.336 --> 01:27:53.716
and I haven't blamed the
media for anything yet.

01:27:53.716 --> 01:27:56.309
I think that one of the
problems that does happen

01:27:56.309 --> 01:27:59.666
with the 24/7 news cycle,

01:27:59.666 --> 01:28:01.069
and we've both been in the government

01:28:01.069 --> 01:28:04.010
in terms of having some response.

01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:05.881
If you don't answer right away,

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:10.226
then whatever administration
is accused of being indecisive.

01:28:10.226 --> 01:28:14.076
If you provide an answer,
like the red line,

01:28:14.076 --> 01:28:17.576
why you are decisive, then the problem is,

01:28:18.507 --> 01:28:20.461
how do you live up to it?

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:22.134
I know in our own experience,

01:28:22.134 --> 01:28:25.384
I know this from we promised in Bosnia,

01:28:26.675 --> 01:28:28.790
in response to Congress,

01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:32.024
that we would be out in
a year and we weren't.

01:28:32.024 --> 01:28:35.352
I learned something, which I
that I think it's a mistake

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.852
to have deadlines or red lines

01:28:38.885 --> 01:28:43.010
because it becomes a gun to your own head.

01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:45.928
It's very hard to stay
away from saying something

01:28:45.928 --> 01:28:49.662
dramatic when you are always
accused of not saying whatever,

01:28:49.662 --> 01:28:51.912
you didn't answer strongly enough.

01:28:51.912 --> 01:28:53.662
That is a real issue.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:57.349
If CNN can make breaking
news for three weeks

01:28:57.349 --> 01:29:01.516
out of an airplane, they are
just looking for something.

01:29:03.576 --> 01:29:05.478
That is an issue.

01:29:05.478 --> 01:29:07.670
The role about Congress that you said,

01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:10.039
I think is very, very important.

01:29:10.039 --> 01:29:12.041
According to the Constitution,

01:29:12.041 --> 01:29:15.298
Congress is an equal
power of the government

01:29:15.298 --> 01:29:17.836
and the way it is set up,

01:29:17.836 --> 01:29:19.800
depending upon what course one takes,

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.700
is called imitation to struggle.

01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:24.774
They have a role and part
of the thing that happens

01:29:24.774 --> 01:29:27.604
is the timing of the Congressional role

01:29:27.604 --> 01:29:31.817
and how the other foreign
audiences actually hear

01:29:31.817 --> 01:29:33.832
what is being said.

01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:38.518
On the issue, for instance, on
Iran that was asked earlier,

01:29:38.518 --> 01:29:42.379
in their discussions about
reimposing sanctions,

01:29:42.379 --> 01:29:46.492
that has some, I would
say, negative effect

01:29:46.492 --> 01:29:48.793
in terms of some of the discussions

01:29:48.793 --> 01:29:52.376
or when Congress puts
automatic sanctions on.

01:29:52.376 --> 01:29:56.866
We have a very rough
relationship with Pakistan,

01:29:56.866 --> 01:29:58.778
partially because there
are automatic sanctions

01:29:58.778 --> 01:30:02.348
that came on over a nuclear issue

01:30:02.348 --> 01:30:04.484
or the Musharraf Coup.

01:30:04.484 --> 01:30:07.119
So instead of being cooperative,

01:30:07.119 --> 01:30:09.784
I think that there is this
struggle that goes on,

01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:13.363
but Congress, that's why we
need to have better information

01:30:13.363 --> 01:30:16.274
between Congress and the Executive Branch.

01:30:16.274 --> 01:30:18.558
It is a co-equal branch of government

01:30:18.558 --> 01:30:20.927
and the Constitution says so,

01:30:20.927 --> 01:30:23.823
and the question is whether
the members of Congress

01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:26.094
actually do their homework.

01:30:26.094 --> 01:30:28.867
It's very interesting that
some members of Congress

01:30:28.867 --> 01:30:31.425
are really proud that
they don't have passports,

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:34.416
not really helpful in terms
of trying to deal with

01:30:34.416 --> 01:30:36.633
international issues.

01:30:36.633 --> 01:30:37.547
- Okay.

01:30:37.547 --> 01:30:41.873
I'm afraid we're going
to have to end it there,

01:30:41.873 --> 01:30:45.209
but I did want to apologize to
those who were still on line.

01:30:45.209 --> 01:30:48.506
I'm sorry that we can't
get all the questions in.

01:30:48.506 --> 01:30:50.152
I did want to thank you
again, Madame Secretary,

01:30:50.152 --> 01:30:51.775
for coming here today.

01:30:51.775 --> 01:30:53.098
I particularly want to thank you

01:30:53.098 --> 01:30:53.994
and everyone should know

01:30:53.994 --> 01:30:55.453
that you've been a real trooper today.

01:30:55.453 --> 01:30:57.673
You have met already with
faculty, with students,

01:30:57.673 --> 01:31:01.723
with post-docs, and with
faculty student post-docs

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:05.858
in the public now, and you
have been absolutely fabulous.

01:31:05.858 --> 01:31:09.253
The John Sloan Dickey Center
is named for one of Dartmouth's

01:31:09.253 --> 01:31:11.731
great presidents, John Sloan Dickey,

01:31:11.731 --> 01:31:14.734
who incidentally was a
State Department man.

01:31:14.734 --> 01:31:19.081
At a critical time, at
the end of World War II

01:31:19.081 --> 01:31:21.255
and the beginning of the post war period,

01:31:21.255 --> 01:31:23.675
and he argued forcefully for engagement

01:31:23.675 --> 01:31:27.503
and left a strong imprint on
many, many Dartmouth grads,

01:31:27.503 --> 01:31:29.299
particularly with his famous remark

01:31:29.299 --> 01:31:31.803
that the world's troubles
are your troubles

01:31:31.803 --> 01:31:33.156
and that there's nothing
wrong with the world

01:31:33.156 --> 01:31:36.061
that better human beings cannot fix.

01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:38.182
I can't think of anyone who embodies

01:31:38.182 --> 01:31:41.373
that kind of moral
imperative more than you do.

01:31:41.373 --> 01:31:42.231
So it's been wonderful.

01:31:42.231 --> 01:31:43.742
- I want to thank you for,

01:31:43.742 --> 01:31:46.060
we were partners in a lot of work,

01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:48.491
your service to the
United States government

01:31:48.491 --> 01:31:51.003
and how lucky Dartmouth
is to have you here.

01:31:51.003 --> 01:31:52.269
- Thank you very much.

01:31:52.269 --> 01:31:54.519
(applause)

01:31:56.095 --> 01:31:58.821
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:31:58.821 --> 01:31:59.904
Thanks a lot.
