00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.990
Want to be a part of an exciting opportunity
to save the planet, feed the world, and make

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.760
some cash? Want to get in on the ground floor
of a revolutionary re-imagining of epic proportions?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.160
Are you a problem-solver with earth-shattering-innovations to offer?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.580
Then answer the call of the NutrientRecycling Challenge $30K giveaway, brought to you by such

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.260
movers and shakers as the EPA,USDA, WWF, NMPF, WERF, ASABE…[mumbles..a couple more word salads]

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.619
AND BEN &amp; JERRY’s ice cream!! I know! I’m excited too!

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.460
What’s that you say? What IS nutrient recycling?
Well, let me tell you! It’s… it’s…

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.940
trying to do something with all the poo…there’s
too much poo.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.800
Hi it's Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget. If there’s one

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.329
sure constant in this world, it’s that everyone
poops. And while discussion of poo is a social

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.530
taboo (couldn’t help myself) and some people
act like theirs doesn’t stink—a sure sign

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.570
they’re full of it—the biggest deuce denial
of all is that surrounding the most monumental

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.799
poo-producers of all time: farmed animals.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.240
In the United States, for example—which
is surprisingly not number one in number two—it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.509
is estimated that livestock animals produce
130 times more waste than the human population—almost

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.780
1.4 billion tons [1.2–1.37]. That comes
out to roughly 5 tons of farmed animal waste

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.840
per U.S. citizen.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.219
With animal excrement piling up in the U.S.
alone at an alarming-yet impressive rate of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.640
116,000 lbs/sec, [52,616.715kg] meaning 7
million pounds/minute [3,175,146.6kg], it’s

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.299
safe to say we’re a bit up the proverbial
creek without a paddle.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.189
This astronomical amount of toxic waste is
100 times more concentrated than raw human

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.670
sewage and more than 500 times more concentrated
than treated human sewage, making it important

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.560
to note that no treatment facilities exist
nor are required for livestock waste.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.270
The greatest offenders of all are pig and
dairy farms, with a 2,500-head dairy cattle

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.050
operation producing a waste load similar to
a city of 61,000 people, and the 35.1 million

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.160
pigs slaughtered in 2015 by a single pork
producer, Smithfield Farms, accounting for

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.870
a very conservative estimate of 95.2 billion
pounds [95,191,200,000lb / 43,178,002,011.144

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.530
kg] pounds of pig poo. Check out this video
for a showcase of Smithfield shoveling it

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.310
on pretty thick with their public relations
pork propaganda.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.660
But where you may see a devastating health
hazard of ground water contamination, air

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.510
pollution, and antibiotic-resistant-pathogen
proliferation, causing everything from respiratory

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.790
illnesses to decreased lung function, to cardiovascular
ailments and even premature death, or perhaps

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.700
an environmental nightmare of nitrogen-flooded
ocean dead zones, habitat destruction, and

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.530
decimation of streams, tributaries, and wetlands,
the Environmental Protection Agency and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.810
it’s crew of—shockingly—pig and dairy
farmers see opportunity!

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.950
See, it’s not toxic waste, it’s “animal
manure containing valuable nutrients.”

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.180
It’s not a mounting global crisis, it’s
“a tremendous opportunity to generate environmental

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.810
and economic benefits from manure.”

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.000
And it’s definitely not about the legal
trouble industry leaders face with repeat

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.700
violations of the Clean Water or Clean Air
Acts, because obviously they’re launching

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.720
this exciting challenge together with the
EPA and USDA, the very organizations charged

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.410
with regulating their illegal activities.
So obviously, everything’s great!

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.570
They’re not irresponsible entities pawning
off their problems, they’re “the Seekers.”

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.370
And you’re not doing their job for them
at a fraction of a fraction of a fraction

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.750
of a fraction of their salaries, you have
the honor of being a “Solver.”

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.910
[Thank goodness for euphemisms, the potpourri
of vocabulary, perfect for masking the smell

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.130
of impropriety!]

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.570
And certainly don’t worry about the fact
that this miraculous manure, or nutrient goldmine,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.150
as it were, is typically a completely unbalanced
fertilizer for plants, containing far too

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.239
much phosphorous.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.460
And most of all, don’t be intimidated by
the enormity of the problem, nor the fact

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.189
that it long ago hit the proverbial fan.

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:30.439
All you have to do is suggest something better
than the current system. Which is basically

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:35.770
storing slurry in giant swimming pools of
sewage called lagoons before literally launching

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.900
it straight up into the air in glorious fecal
fountains that put Las Vegas to shame and

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.620
shower local residents with a refreshing mist
of eau de poo. In other words, the bar is

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.460
low.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.080
While phase I of submissions has already passed,
the implementation of the lucky winners is

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.180
yet to come. So hold onto the edge of your
toilet seat—I know I will—to see where

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.819
the excitement will lead!

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.590
While the United States is the only country
I’m aware of that’s created an official

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.129
challenge for dealing with it’s crap—which
is, after all, the American way given our

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:17.860
obsession with reality TV—yet another unstoppable
influx of sh-ining examples of brilliant entertainment!—before

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.999
you lay the stink of the world at America’s
back door, it’s important to note that this

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.689
is a global issue. From the gut of Germany,
through the intestines of India, and fecal

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.150
channels of China, into the bowels of Brazil,
past the colon of Columbia, to the nether

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.289
regions of the Netherlands, and out the a—nus
of America, animals are everywhere, and every

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.499
one of them poops.

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:44.400
Now if you think this is just some craptastic
video that I’m pulling out of my—well,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.430
y’know—rest assured that I’m nothing
if not anal about my fecal facts.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.150
Because regardless of the brevity of this
bowel-movement-homage, I spent many hours

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.120
performing a virtual investigative colonoscopy
on the waste management world to ensure this

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.610
sh-ow was tight. I’d encourage you to check
out the blog post linked in the video description,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.599
where you’ll find links to my own mountain
of shi-mmering citations and resources. And

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.490
if you want to help me make more quality crap,
feel free to join the Nugget Army where we

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.430
shoot the sh- we schmooze on a regular basis.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.879
I’d love to hear your thoughts on this steaming
pile of a project proposal in the comments

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:26.939
below. Just dump em’ right down there. Really
let it all go. If you liked this admittedly

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.969
corny nugget (okay that’s a bit much), give
the video a thumbs up and spread it around

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.919
with the fury of the factory farm fecal fountains
themselves! And subscribe for more vegan crap

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.779
every Monday, Wednesday, and some Fridays!
Now go live vegan, call the industry on it’s—you

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.700
know by now—and I’ll see you soon!

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.320
This is where they spray animal waste on us. This is about eight feet from my mother's house.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.400
You think it's raining.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.620
We don't open the doors or the windows, but the odor still comes in. It takes your breath away.
