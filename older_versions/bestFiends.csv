Miss Bird introduces Gwen to Best Fiends Forever, an idle clicker where you and your Fiends beat up evil slugs from Mount Boom! Also. Cats. Because.

Gwen ► ____________

LYRICS:
Coming down the pathways from the mountain!
Clogging every cranny they can find!
Being little jerks and kind of slimy,
and they’re stealing countless hours of our time!

Now they’re oozing loose around Minutia,
and there’s just one way for us to slow them down!
All we need’s a little app installed;
the rest is all a snap; it’s called
Best Fiends Forever. That is all
it takes to take slugs down!

Are you feeling ready for this showdown?
Maybe if you tell me how to fight.
slapping slugs is really pretty simple,
plus your Fiends can help you overcome each plight!

Hold your phone LIKE THIS and begin tapping!
Tap the slugs to make them go away!
Use your rapid-fire tapping
to consistently keep slapping—
okay, quit your endless yapping
and please let me try to play.

Slugs are on our phones and in our faces!
Slugs are on our minds and in our hearts!
Slugs invade my night out with my boyfriend!
Slugs tear our relationship ap- oh, hey! Thanks, honey!

Find yourself new fiends and pick up treasure!
Be the greatest slug slapper around!
Download free Best Fiends Forever!
Yes, they paid us, but whatever!
Cause we’re down to take slugs down!","1

was leave the contact lens pot because

309
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:28,240
that's what you do before you go to

310
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,740
sleep fine you got it wrong I just

311
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,069

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,720
it's also a really good drink to protect

25
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,659
you against cold get a good-sized lemon

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,520

27
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,430
the slices to make them fit into a

28
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,470

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,470

63
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,860
I'll have to play best beans and whoosh

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,170

touch your top left

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,250
first I apply a neutral color beige

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,340
shadow up to my browbone then I

73
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,920
generally apply pink on my eyelid and on

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,140
the outer corner of my eyes I make my

75
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,610
brush is fast fading the color from the

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,160
outer corner to the inner

77
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,290
corner of my eyes that would be purple

78
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,810
eyeliner that comes with a palette I

79
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,290
apply a very thin line on my eye line

80
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,450
move up or move down rush rates to

81
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,000
decrease then I filled all out for the

82
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,550
purple eyeliner color to create a cool

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,010
cat eye effect now again with the same

84
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,980
paint color we used before I'll apply it

85
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,980
only on the outer edges and then start

86
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,620
smudging it with my brush car I used to

87
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,940
play this long and super thin lashes

88
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,160
it's from Helena Rubinstein and bad it

89
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,959
doesn't I don't at the yellow ah it's

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,390
time I recorded video there was no one

91
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,209
in the bottle anymore so my eyes is

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,820
haven't reached its ultimate form it's

93
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,800
like a smoky pink cat eye super cool

94
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,880
super pretty and then I'll just add a

95
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,740
little pink blush on my cheeks and then

96
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,560
top it with a sheer layer of orange

97
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,810
blush it looks so natural and so cute

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,430
just like these these barn colors are

99
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,140
actually coming out of your skin

100
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,020
everything common you guys tooth tries

101
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,510
with two blush colors then autumn there

102
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,910
are still some deserts a little bit warm

103
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,580
here in Japan you know lipstick red

104
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,930
lipstick is more like for vendor so what

105
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,520
I do is I take a reddish lip tint so for

106
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,890
let them just apply like in the center

107
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,680
of your lips and this much a lot and

108
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,620
you're a lipstick and vendor all right

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,690
now onto fashion that can fall are

110
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,490
generally just around Halloween I prefer

111
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,830
to learn darker code that I can't leave

112
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,319
my pink

113
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,379
well some pick me up and this card is

114
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,300
perfect for Japanese Adam probably seen

115
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,870
this before but this is my deal of

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,360
rainbow backpack I use it all year

117
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:32,099
around because hey rainbows aren't

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,740
subject to any season autumn or fall or

119
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:37,830
upon you whatever you call it it's also

120
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,169
my favorite time for shopping because in

121
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,810
Japan you can just buy the cutest

122
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:45,599
clothes youngest food and Halloween

123
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,819
accessories there's like so much

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,430
Halloween decoration and Halloween candy

125
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,009
but the thing is it actually don't like

126
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,770
scary things and I get scared really

127
00:05:53,009 --> 00:06:19,080
really easily so myself it looks so

128
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:22,740
scary yeah but if you're looking for a

129
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,259
pumpkin spice latte then I'm afraid to

130
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,440
tell you dad you're at the wrong place

131
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,330
so now I'm in the mall and here's this

132
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,560
actually on Starbucks and you know how

133
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,720

134
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,720
[Music]

135
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,360
some kids pious lucky but sure they

136
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:46,680
don't do any pumpkin spice lattes

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,630
granola cappuccino but I've no tried so

138
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,599
I don't know what an album elf

139
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,580
cappuccino case like and I also you know

140
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,699
why do you go through pumpkin spice

141
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,669
latte now I remember that I never never

142
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,380
ever actually had a pumpkin spice latte

143
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,360
okay so let's go for something

144
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,229
television because I don't know what I

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,220
didn't - I know I don't think of bottom

146
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:15,150
Halloween breakfast and guys over here

147
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,680

148
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,539
Kreme I should really get some

149
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,539
controlling doughnuts for me I'm a

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,880
serious about the almond milk latte and

151
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,569
I'm back and I also got a mustard

152
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,449
it's April we no speak English

153
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:39,440
Apple mustard bacon Apple sandwich what

154
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,440
the heck Starbucks

155
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,470
with normal and

156
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,199
[Music]

157
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,720
one time they did a really rare

158
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,370
combination sandwich but I remember that

159
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,050
it was weird but if I can't remember

160
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,970
what it was even though it was weird it

161
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,550
means that he wasn't actually dad beard

162
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,810
I thought he was a writer there was a

163
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:27,930
300 coin shop which is basically a three

164
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,300
dollar store now Japan 100 yen shops are

165
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,419
really popular hundred yen shops are

166
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,340
equal to one dollar stores in the u.s.

167
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,229
that the difference between 200 and 300

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:42,780
yen shop is simply that obviously the

169
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:46,500
300 yen shopper every and each item

170
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,980
costs only 300 yen there's just a much

171
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,140
better selection and the quality of the

172
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,640
product is also a lot better here like

173
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,150

188
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:39,030

what you're such a dad he's such a dad

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,590
that I think it's time for a change so

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,650

36
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,000

37
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,799

40
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,890
that Millennials have embraced

41
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,630
unemployment Wow

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,299
that was a good one so one thing that's

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,750
all the rage right now is contouring

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,329
look at those cheekbones okay are you

45
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,060

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,070
you can't smile though sorry it's fine

47
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,090

smile we're unemployed oh you know I

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,460

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,950
here

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,630
I heard okay well let the face why don't

52
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,350
we just hit up those eyebrows so when

53
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,170
was the last time you were hit um

54
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,400
yesterday what happened I feel like I'm

55
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,240
Santa Claus

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,550
no definitely not hmm that looks good I

57
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,650
do look like Santa Claus why do you

58
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,090
think you look like Santa Claus cuz I'm

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,790
slaying this I'm done I'm done

60
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm absolutely how long have you been

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,570
waiting to make that joke you probably

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,810
did you know what's happening he was

63
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,840
like other comedians I can't use that

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,700
one I cannot so you almost look the part

65
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,630
but you're missing something and that's

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,810
something is trendy sweatpants

67
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:50,100
sweatpants aren't trendy yes they are we

68
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,470

those on in a sec yeah I don't do this

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,520
so now that you look young and hip we

71
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,440
need to teach you how to act young and

72
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,360
hip your face is already done

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,070
which means you should probably take a

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,799
selfie so people know that you tried

75
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,400

are so cool they're so fun but to do

118
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,769
today

119
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:58,040
when your dad's a drummer don't work so

120
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,110
sitting here holding baby janae while

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,000
she sleeps is so sweet and it makes me

122
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,920
so tired I want to take a nap so bad

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,740
right now so here's what I was thinking

124
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,570
poll question do you guys like naps or

125
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,339
how often in the week do you take a nap

126
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,959
I love naps

127
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,640
especially when I'm pregnant when I have

128
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,170
a new baby or when I'm a mother or when

129
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,950
I'm in college or when I'm in a high

130
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,930
school or I think I just like that so

131
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,060
but I don't get to take naps as often as

132
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,190
I would like lately since Jenny's been

133
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,839
born I've taken a little bit more so I

134
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,640
guess a couple times a week had taken

135
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,180
that maybe they're usually just power

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,589
naps

137
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,860
the power nap is an interesting

138
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,990
phenomenon Jeremy does really well with

139
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,250
a power nap if he takes a long nap he

140
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:43,339
wakes up Google Inc do you like to nap

141
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,470
kinda sometimes the lightest debt when

142
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,740
he takes long one to get scrump

143
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,300
it's called sleep inertia he has so much

144
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,399
sleep in a long nap that then he wants

145
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,959
more

146
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,470
his body's like I was supposed to sleep

147
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,709
all night

148
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:02,930
oh yeah

149
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:05,870
Isaac always wakes up grumpy what looks

150
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:11,540

151
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:15,260

babies named Ferdinand this is the one

154
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,170

155
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,800
name yeah what are those babies doing

156
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,010

now and relative level 13 so we're going

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,550
to start at level 13 and the first

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,100
person to get to Liverpool tape is the

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,800
winner for that round and the loser has

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,510
to pick a challenge out of this hat and

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,070
it's either going to be a dance or an

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,200
aqua child and they must complete the

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,520

must complete

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:21,830
let's see yes so basically we have to

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,350
connect and match three leads

31
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:29,520
strawberries mushrooms or water drops to

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,080
defeat the slugs each round requires you

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,720
do something a little bit different so

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,700
in one man in might get you to defeat

35
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,649
three slugs and collect two diamonds or

36
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,869

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,030

breeland's madness this has become one

15
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,750
of the most absolutely ridiculous

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,780
DIY trends of all time pen O'Meara I

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,100
would love to hear what you think I

18
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,110
think you purposely picked this phone

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,850
project because best fiends is

20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,350
sponsoring the episode that wouldn't be

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,670
halfway from the truth because they are

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,960
now between you and I I didn't think I

23
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,239
was going to jump on the whole best

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,649
fiends bandwagon but hell I saw enough

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,030
of everyone else's sponsored videos but

26
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,680
I finally downloaded the day it was free

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,629
the game is ridiculously addictive I'm

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,430
having very odd dreams since I started

29
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,410
playing it it's as mind numbing matching

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,210
puzzle game where you collect and kind

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,090
of upgrade all these weird characters in

32
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,950
which you then use to blow up slugs

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,119
which is obviously why I like it you

34
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,380
know you blow things up you can play

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,030
without the internet which means I'm

36
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,250
constantly on it when I'm not supposed

37
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,270
to be what up I'm not gonna lie pretty

38
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,460
much fuck I'm killing it right now

39
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,320

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,790

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,710
kind of free gift a lot of people are

44
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,880
into this whole pokemons go madness when

45
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,290
we tell you something as much as

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,210
everyone says that I get for me out of

47
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,340
the house and I meet so many new people

48
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,960
that sounds like a goddamn nightmare to

49
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,180
me I'm gonna be sitting my ass down on

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,799
my couch in the comfort of my own home

51
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,540
killing slugs and matching up purple

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,430
mushrooms but that that's just me with

53
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,380
all that said we now commence onto this

54
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,450
week's project the edible phone case

55
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,909
what the fuck for this project I'm

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,909
taking the edible plate open and making

57
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,610
myself a edible phone case to end all

58
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,950
edible phone cases what I'm calling the

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,780
go your cell phone case for this you're

60
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,480
gonna need all the stuff to make edible

61
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,640
play the first thing I bust

62
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,950
my scale but I definitely do not use to

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,840
weigh drugs on and I wake myself out one

64
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,370
pound of mini marshmallows I'm helping

65
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,200
all this down by microwaving it in

66
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,210
30-second intervals and occasionally

67
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,650
adding a couple teaspoons of water once

68
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,660
it was all melted and had no lumps I

69
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,160
slowly added two pounds of powdered

70
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,840
sugar and just let you know upfront this

71
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,610
mixing process is a goddamn nightmare

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,410
takes a lot of time and takes a lot of

73
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,480
effort two things that I do not have a

74
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,820
lot of or that I like to spare at this

75
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,770
point I'm actually pretty happy with

76
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,360
this surprise that I did not fuck that

77
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,890
after kneading it and molding it looks

78
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,090
actually pretty decent so it moves out

79
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,620
of the next step which was taking some

80
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,840
Crisco which I'm honestly not even sure

81
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,340
what the it is vegetable shortening with

82
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,440
a whole bunch of fucking weird

83
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,960
ingredients in it and I lathered up my

84
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,180
counter along with my hands then just

85
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,490
needed it some more slathered it up drop

86
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,290
it in some cellophane and put it in the

87
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,210
fridge overnight the next day I took it

88
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,610
out and began mixing in with some of my

89
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,950
food dye I'm using this copper food gel

90
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,360
to achieve my human hand color once it

91
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,860
was all evenly mixed I had broken off

92
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,260
some of the pieces in began molding them

93
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,910
in two fingers I grabbed my phone to

94
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,580
measure out the size of the actual hand

95
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,800
then proceeded to carefully add on each

96
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,830
finger then with a toothpick I began

97
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,840
adding small little hand details for the

98
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,810
fingernails I'm using this white cake

99
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,390
frosting which is genius the end results

100
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,330
this thing this thing looks amazing if

101
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,730
this project wasn't as stupid as it is I

102
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,650
would actually want this phone case

103
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,900
it definitely acts as the most perfect

104
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,760
response to any parental figure nagging

105
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,200

This is not a DIY Experiment Life Hacks like I usually do but a comical take on Lies Everyone Tells! Normally I do simple life hacks that can save your life as well as diy science with crayons, coke bottle and more. Do you tell these lies when you are back to school? The next video may be a life hack or perhaps a diy or routine not sure yet what do you think? Love, Wengie

hi guys in today's video I'm going to be

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,529
showing you how to make three different

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,299
types of slime

4
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,859
the first slime is bubbly slime the

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,660
second one is hollow slime which is my

6
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,550
absolute favorite and the third is mat

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,230
slime this video is sponsored by best

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,790
fiends and I've been so obsessed with

9
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,320
this game recently you're given missions

10
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,270
on each level but the main aim of the

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,619
game is to match up same color objects

12
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,420
and defeat the slugs then when the

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,250
levels completed you're given three keys

14
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,779
that unlock various prizes which you can

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,609
use to level up your characters strength

16
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,260
making it a lot easier to defeat the

17
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,970
slugs in the next level the game is free

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,590

27
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,649
level you guys get to I currently on

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,510
level 31 and I want to see if you can

29
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,280
beat me the first time we're going to be

30
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,469
making a sublease lime and for this

31
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,329
we're going to need some PVA glue a tiny

32
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,739
bit of shaving foam a little bit of

33
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,870
cornstarch just to thicken up the

34
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,760
mixture and loads and loads of foaming

35
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,680
hand wash my secret ingredient that I

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,840
use in every bubbly slime I make is

37
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,670
Imperial lava foam bath body wash

38
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
product comes out as a gel as you can

39
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,450
see here when it's stirred and it

40
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,040
becomes so bubbly and foaming up so much

41
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,930
air into sand mix which means we'll get

42
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
loads of bubble it also doubles the size

43
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,500
of this mixture so my slime is also a

44
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,259
lot bigger when I use this product and

45
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,150
it smells so so nice after I've settled

46
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,799
that in I just go into my paint and

47
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,720
absent color to that and then we want to

48
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,369
activate our slime and this is a really

49
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,470
really tricky one to get right because

50
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,450
even when it's completely activated the

51
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,829
slime looks like it's sticky so it's

52
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,960
really important to go in with your

53
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,369
hands and just feel the texture if it

54
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,170
isn't sticky then you want to stop

55
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,670
adding your axe face it and put it into

56
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,590
an airtight container it's really

57
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,540
important put bubbly slams into an

58
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,100
airtight container because then all of

59
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,079
the bubbles are sucked to the top and it

60
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,430
makes it really crispy this is what the

61
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,430
bubbles look like after two days

62
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,210
next up we have hollow crunch slime

63
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,770
which is so so pretty

64
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,480
we're going to view Stars and I got

65
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,520
these off Amazon I think I just cool

66
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,590
holographic styles with decorative stars

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,970
and then I also use pigment that as you

68
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,650
can see here it doesn't really show up

69
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,850
as hollow when it's far away so I think

70
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,500
there's something like a silver

71
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,150
eyeshadow can probably be used as the

72
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
base color after you've added those two

73
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,630
together you want to start adding your

74
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,250
quickly we're mixing it all in when

75
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,080
you've mixed in lots of packs of glitter

76
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,030
and it started to fall apart you can go

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,890
ahead and activate it I like always plan

78
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,780
with crunchy slimes a lot better to fold

79
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,490
the mixture in rolls and stir it so the

80
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,530
glue has a chance to pull together and

81
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,030
after the mixture is fully activated if

82
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,500
you want a bit more crunch you can just

83
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,240
go ahead with your stars and just add a

84
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,680
bit more the clear glue would have made

85
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,150
them mixture super cloudy when you've

86
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,770
mixed everything in so I recommend

87
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:53,280
leaving it for two days to let it clear

88
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:54,960
up and then it becomes very pretty the

89
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,940
next time has been slow requested on my

90
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,680
channel and this is max loam father's

91
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,720
we're going to need some PVA glue some

92
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,340
shaving foam and also some cornstarch so

93
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,170
it's kind of like a fluffy slime recipe

94
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,700
instead of having equal amounts of

95
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,680
shaving foam and cornstarch we're going

96
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,300
to have loads of cornstarch and this is

97
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,860
going to be our masa fiying agent for

98
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,540
this slime if the mixture looks like a

99
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,040
fluffy slime after you've mixed it in

100
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,020
you want to go ahead and add some more

101
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,670
cornstarch and I do recommend doing this

102
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,709
gradually so we don't just end up with a

103
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,780
dough paste we do want it to still be a

104
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,280
slime texture and then once everything's

105
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,200
really thick we can go ahead without

106
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,730
activator and I didn't find that this

107
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,350
needed marked really felt like he was

108
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,630
over activated even though I knew it

109
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,580
wasn't so I kept playing there and after

110
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,650
playing with it it turned out so so nice

111
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,510
and it was really smooth and soft to

112
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,040
play with I really hope that you enjoyed

113
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,750

brow else what a trimmer brow careful

177
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,850

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,450
comes to the brows I wouldn't say go

179
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,620
with this agreed and it's dangerous so

180
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,440
negative 5

181
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,480
in conclusion yes ma'am next up are

182
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,890
these mini blenders now we've had

183
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,720
experience with the actual Beauty

184
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,510
Blender and past video maybe too much

185
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,650
experience yeah I got a mint when I

186
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,370
first saw it I thought they were candy

187
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:53,170
it look exactly like how Candide should

188
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,860
look those like a little easter egg so

189
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,890
our little teardrops why do you eat

190
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,720
those every time I'm like maybe they're

191
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,030
flavored how innovated would that be

192
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,250
you're doing your makeup is like and

193
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,990
mint they just look like candy and

194
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:10,300
they're not yet handy which makes me sad

195
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,840
so maybe they're small so you can put it

196
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,340
on your dolls why is it so small I think

197
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,990
really more like more pinpoint areas

198
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,460
like the inside of the eyes probably

199
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,270
like a big one around the grip of the

200
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:25,960
nose the ear ear plugs that's what they

201
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,520
are yeah it's not good being ear plug

202
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,750
don't in my mouth just say another one

203
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,090
this time about what ellezi yeah ah next

204
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,530
up hair towels I'd always thought you

205
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,180
could just use regular towels but I

206
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,980
guess not they selling a specific towel

207
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,290

208
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,030

210
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,750
it looks like a giant slug I don't want

211
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,250

and then this and then there's a little

216
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,610
thing in the bag you tuck it into like

217
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,030

00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,740
I don't want to do this someone to trim

241
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:57,980
out I know maybe this is better smells

242
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,260
like a toilet t-shirt made for your size

243
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,940
ends no they weren't there with no lady

244
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,800
hands so I don't know what to do now it

245
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,450
looks so weird it looks like milky

246
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
almost in the middle it's dripping and

247
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,020
then no one could do that it dripped it

248
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,700
into the second one oh you smile thank

249
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,500
you yeah then we get these off base huh

250
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,940
yeah it's a ball machine the robots are

251
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,140
so we have under step outside of our

252
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,660
comfort zone and do something we've

253
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,420
never done before and that is mascara

254
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,740
and this stuff scares being like

255
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,660
entertaining so close to your eye and

256
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,340
Devon already has that people compliment

257
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,740

258
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,030
you know this up literally is pretty

259
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,500
scary to me because I feel you could

260
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,480
like easily poke yourself in the eye

261
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,700
whatever mascara is made out of you have

262
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,410
that a hole in your eyes and is mascara

263
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,120
the stuff that you put on your eyelashes

264
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,190
residence or something put above your

265
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,500
eyelashes like you're on your eyelids no

266
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,820
eyelashes I don't know what the size

267
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,310
requirements are but this feels

268
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,370
excessive this stuff does not look like

269
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,230

SAVE THE BILBY: https://savethebilbyfund.com/","1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
when you live in an area that has

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:05,430
constant unchanging weather anytime a

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,379
changes it's a big deal

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,150
take for instance thunderstorms they

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,620
only happen twice a year at school

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,299
people would be running around and

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,650
screaming as if the world was collapsing

8
00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:18,270
it's hard to notice when the seasons

9
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,740
change I've always wanted to be in a

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,990
place where the leaves would change

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,910
color during the fall so where I live

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,140
fall is always late so you never notice

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,930
it until it's gone

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,849
winter is only slightly colder and not

15
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,980
really noticeable there is however one

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,660
season I can always count on it's

17
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,940
noticeable when you're driving home from

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,649
work the flowers usually bloom along the

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,750
freeway and that's the indication that

20
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,399
spring is here spring has just started

21
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,649
very recently and I don't know about you

22
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,480
but spring gives me a ton of energy well

23
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,100
the days are bright and sunny the bees

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,850
are out pollinating everything just

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,190
feels really calm spring is also the

26
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,050
time for Easter I did a little research

27
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,329

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,129

50
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,020
Easter was always fun and my family

51
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,570
growing up we would decorate eggs and go

52
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,490
out Easter egg hunting my mom started

53
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,250
this tradition one year where instead of

54
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,560
hunting for eggs during the day we would

55
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,119
do it at night she would put little glow

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,590
stick greens on the eggs and hide them

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,750
in the backyard I thought that the

58
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,070
Easter Bunny was kind of weird though he

59
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,969
runs around giving up chocolates a

60
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,790
little kid

61
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,459
look at I love Santa I guess why is it

62
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,080
that most holidays center around someone

63
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,760
sneaking into your house while you're

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,350
asleep at least the Easter Bunny doesn't

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,600
collect teeth that's

66
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,490
growth I was reading some articles about

67
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,670
Easter and I came across an Easter

68
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,620
tradition in Australia apparently they

69
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,900
have what's called the Easter bill B

70
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,270
bill these are native Australian

71
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,850
marsupials that are endangered to raise

72
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,110
money and increase awareness of

73
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:33,090
conservation efforts bill be shaped

74
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,040
chocolates and related merchandise are

75
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,530
sold within many stores throughout

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Australia as an alternative to Easter

77
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,750
bunnies

78
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,610
not only are you celebrating a holiday

79
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,680
but you are helping preserve an

80
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,960
endangered animal I mean look at this

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,050
thing it's adorable I'll take the Easter

82
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,030
building over the Easter Bunny any day

83
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,370
Easter always reminds me of a story that

84
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,230
I read in an LDS magazine once I can't

85
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,970
find the article online which kind of

86
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,890
makes me sad but every year around

87
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,480
Easter I think about it right I always

88
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,050
wanted to be part of this big Easter egg

89
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,580
hunt

90
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,080
there were many egg safai on the hunt

91
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,000
but there were some special eggs among

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,280
the normal colored ones these eggs were

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,860
gold and contains special prizes inside

94
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,600
there were only ten I believe so finding

95
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,400
one would be extremely rare the hunt

96
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,810
started and a multitude of kids ran as

97
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,160
fast as they could

98
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,200
there are many different colored eggs

99
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,270
but everyone wanted to find the golden

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,740
ones a few minutes go by and Ryan

101
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,440
actually finds one of the golden eggs

102
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,990
but then he noticed something strange

103
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,880
there was a mom on the hunt grounds he

104
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,370
noticed that she had a little child with

105
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,290
her he watched as the mom was taking her

106
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,180
child's hands and directing them to

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,000
where the eggs were the little boy was

108
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,830
blind and needed help to find them each

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,720
time she spotted an egg she would try to

110
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,610
get him to pick it up but each time

111
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,420
another kid would grab it before the kid

112
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,040
could even touch it

113
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,080
Brian looked down at the golden egg and

114
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,880
walked over to the mom confused the

115
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,620
mother watched as Ryan put down the

116
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,810
golden egg in front of her boy and

117
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,790
watched as the boy's eyes filled up with

118
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,100
excitement with tears in her eyes the

119
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,750
mom thanked Ryan I think the story

120
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,790
really embodies what Easter is about

121
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,450
Easter is a sign of new beginning and

122
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,280
new hope

123
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,460
so I hope you guys have a good Easter

124
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,810
this year regardless it's if you don't

125
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,940
celebrate it then I hope you have a good

126
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,220
spring sorry I haven't posted in like

127
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,790

back to school so I haven't had time to

Johanna and in this video we're going to

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,170
play a game which I'm sure no one's

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,320
heard of before and it's called witch

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:17,900
slime are you so all you have to do is

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,029
give this video a thumbs up and the last

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:22,279
two digits of the number you get is

8
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:24,230
going to be your sign if you happen to

9
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,060
get a number larger than 20 then simply

10
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,160
add the two digits together to get your

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,650
final score if you actually get zero

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,570
zero then you're going to be ex line and

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,850

36
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:22,610

37
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,830
involved and you keep on finding out new

38
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,590
tricks as you go along as you can see

39
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,430
here I'm on level 366 and I've also

40
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,930

42

and give it a try I can say from

54
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,440
personal experience that you rarely find

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,350
a free game that's this entertaining and

56
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,820
fun to play all of the slimes in this

57
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,950
video were based on your amazing

58
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,960
suggestions many things were mentioned

59
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,850
more than once so I tried my best to

60
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,710
credit the first person who posted a

61
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,240
particular idea so remember

62
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,280
to give this video a thumbs-up and then

63
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,460
keep on watching to see which slime you

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,460
get

65
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,419
[Applause]

66
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,590
[Music]

67
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,430
so for this one I decided to try

68
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,080
something a bit different

69
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,849
first I cut off the top of a fake rose

70
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,670
and then I hot-glued it inside a plastic

71
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:36,260
Easter egg then I filled up the

72
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,300
surrounding space with clear slime I

73
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,980
think this looks really pretty and it

74
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:43,489
could be a nice way to package slime or

75
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:45,110
just the user's room decor of course it

76
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,879
wasn't that fun to play with since the

77
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,530
flowers fixed in place but it was a

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,160
surprisingly fun and aesthetic

79
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,160
experiment

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,140
I'll be using supplies from solar

81
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,479
color.com for many of the slimes in this

82
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,040
video they make amazing stuff for

83
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,180
crafting and I couldn't wait to try out

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,180
this black holo glitter

85
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,569
I also added these chroma flakes which

86
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,069
are shimmering iridescent flakies so the

87
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,669
light can reflect off different sized

88
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,669
particles

89
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,130
not surprisingly this slime turned out

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,870
really well and I filmed it here in

91
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,800
direct sunlight so you can see the full

92
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,800
holographic effect

93
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,220
the person who suggested this idea is

94
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,120
very clever because you know I have a

95
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,620
soft spot for everything hamster related

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,420
this is my hamster pudding who loves to

97
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,210
eat so she's not happy that I'm taking

98
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,980
her food away for this video

99
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,140
this one is fluffy who's a robo hamster

100
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,460
and a lot more shy she lets me stroke

101
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,790
her head but she doesn't like being

102
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,790
picked up

103
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,139
for this slime I decided to use teabags

104
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,430
that work with cold water because I

105
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,749
thought that might make it easier to

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,749
transfer color and scent

107
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,220
I genuinely had high hopes this one

108
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,540
because it sounds like a great idea

109
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,610
however has quite disappointed when the

110
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,120
slime started turning watery and foamy

111
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,680
and then it became an unexpected fail

112
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,570
the only upside is that actually smells

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,320
very nice but I'm afraid you can't get

114
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,320
that through the video

115
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,810
[Applause]

116
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,539
for this one I obviously had to use all

117
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:21,110
60 urban decay naked eye shadows that we

118
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,270
mix together for this video here first I

119
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:28,129
made five small slimes using all the eye

120
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:38,149
shadows from each Naked palette then I

121
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:39,769
combined everything together the

122
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,630
shimmery eye shadows turned the slime

123
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:59,209
into a nice metallic color and it was

124
00:08:41,630 --> 00:09:01,070
really nice to poke this is care fresh

125
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,589
bedding which is a paper-based substrate

126
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,089
that hamsters love to dig through I was

127
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,459
really quite curious how this would

128
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,529
react with clear slime so it turns out

129
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:11,180
that carefresh bedding absorbs a lot of

130
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,699
moisture and it turns the slime into a

131
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,949
hard lump this is quite an unusual

132
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:18,490
texture but it wasn't at all satisfying

133
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,490
to play with

134
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,630
I was very excited to test out this idea

135
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,530
since lush shower jellies already have

136
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:28,060
such a satisfying texture however I

137
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,160
realized that the jellies are harder to

138
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,950
pull apart than expected and it doesn't

139
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,870
blend that well into the slime the more

140
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,580
tried mixing it the foam ear everything

141
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:48,880
became until it just turned into a

142
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:50,710
sticky mess the worst part is that this

143
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,250
mixture was incredibly difficult to

144
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,320
clean up

145
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,270
normal slimes will dissolve quite easily

146
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,280
with soap and water but this for some

147
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,110
reason turned even stickier and it

148
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,120
literally took me 30 minutes to get

149
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,800
everything off my table so not

150
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,630
surprisingly this was my least favorite

151
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,900
slime out of all the ones from this

152
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,900
video

153
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:25,999
a lot of people have requested a remake

154
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,059
of the rose gold slime from my very

155
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:31,249
first slime video so this time I started

156
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:34,779
with a gold pigment followed by copper

157
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:34,779
and a tiny bit of pink food coloring

158
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:41,149
this ended up a bit too red so I added a

159
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:45,429
bunch of white luster dust and this

160
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,429
produced the perfect rose gold slime

161
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,540
the next slime idea is so bougie and I

162
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,700
love it I actually managed to get hold

163
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,620
of crystal pixie which is the newest and

164
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,230
pioneers version of Swarovski crystals

165
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,120
meant to be used for nail art there's

166
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,500
almost no way the slime could go wrong

167
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,500
so just sit back and enjoy

168
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,899
this is such a great comment and I would

169
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:07,999
have loved to try everything if I had

170
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:12,399
more slime but for this video I decided

171
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:12,399
to go with the lip gloss / lipstick idea

172
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,240
for this time I'm using the leftover 24

173
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,370
karat gold leaf that I bought for this

174
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,390
lip-balm DIY though you can easily get

175
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,390
cheaper versions online

176
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,230
I think this looks absolutely gorgeous

177
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,970
but this is definitely the most

178
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,829
expensive time to make no matter what

179
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,660
type of gold leaf you use since there's

180
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:33,370
no way you can extract the gold back out

181
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:35,259
again I assume that you guys mint this

182
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,839
type of magic snow which contains a gel

183
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:39,730
that expands in water I was very excited

184
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,350
to try it out because I've seen so many

185
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,139
slimes that have this texture on

186
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,579
Instagram just making the snow was

187
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,579
incredibly satisfying to do

188
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,160
I added the slime and started mixing but

189
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,600
I was disappointed to see that

190
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,600
everything started turning sticky

191
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:15,300
thankfully I managed to fix this using

192
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,860
more slime activator I love how the

193
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,720
texture turned out however I'm going to

194
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:25,920
jazz it up even more using some color

195
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:28,050
changing and Purdy pigments this blue to

196
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,360
purple UV pigments from solar color dust

197
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:32,870
looks so aesthetic and it was incredible

198
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,870
to play with

199
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,440
[Music]

200
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,850
as a cleaning tip if the fake snow gets

201
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,620
everywhere then simply leave it to dry

202
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,450
and then you can sweep it up easily and

203
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,100
just put it in the bin whatever you do

204
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,960
don't wash it down the sink otherwise

205
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,320
we'll just absorb the water and clog up

206
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,320
your pipes

207
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,179
I can already guess that this slime is

208
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,899
going to be very messy so I'm going to

209
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,899
make it on a plate

210
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,820
it turned out incredibly sticky however

211
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,309
it actually peels off your skin without

212
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,870
leaving any residue but it's definitely

213
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,940
too soft to play with and most

214
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,360
surprisingly it didn't smell as good as

215
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,360
you might expect

216
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,880
this comment was so creative and you

217
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,320
guys thought so too based on the number

218
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,700
of uploads since I already took so many

219
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,830
screenshots for the different slime

220
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:31,370
ideas I simply compile them into one

221
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:32,780
image and then cut everything out it

222
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,580
feels like there's some sort of message

223
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,140
behind the slime like you should be

224
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,530
making a statement about youtubers

225
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,420
comments haters or social media this was

226
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:45,490
great fun to do but of course it's not

227
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,490
the most satisfying slime there is I

228
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:01,700
[Applause]

229
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,770
thought it might be interesting to try

230
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,770
felting some wool into some slime

231
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:30,799
however these two obviously didn't mix

232
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:32,869
very well together I also tried mixing

233
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,759
wall directly into slime and this made a

234
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,759
less stretchy and more likely to rip

235
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,029
last but not least let's make some

236
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,649
chicken nuggets slime I'm sure that many

237
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,539
people are getting ready to write angry

238
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,159
comments about wasting food but please

239
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,989
remember that I were youtuber and it's

240
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,119
my job to make weird videos that

241
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,799
entertain people and I really don't

242
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,149
think that anyone would be interested in

243
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,149
making the slime themselves

244
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,279
this is obviously not the best slime

245
00:22:21,389 --> 00:22:26,429
I've ever made but it's definitely not

246
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,289
as gross as I imagined it didn't feel at

247
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:30,509
all greasy or squishy and most

248
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:33,919
unexpectedly the fried chicken smell

249
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:33,919
wasn't bad when combined with slime

250
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:54,719
thank you so much for watching and I

251
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,789
hope you enjoyed this collection of

252
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:58,139
weird and wonderful slimes don't forget

iPhone Case: https://riflepaperco.com/shop/phone-cases/","1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,640
Hey guys, it’s Ro! I am currently hanging
out in my bedroom, I got Cookie behind

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,210
me, she’s taking a snooze! Some of you may
notice that I have a new bed,

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,059
it is super comfy! I think after this video
I may take snooze with this one

4
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:14,480
and watch some Netflix!

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,460
You can’t see it, but there’s a TV over
here, and this is amazing!

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,910
But, today, I got so many requests to make
a new what’s on my iPhone video,

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,320
because a lot of you noticed when I was doing
the challenge videos that I got

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,160
a new phone, and I was thinking about it and
I have been using a ton of new apps

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,790
that I would love to share with you.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,390
Starting with the phone itself, I got an iPhone 6
with 128 gigs of storage because

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,450
I take a lot of photos and videos, so I thought,
that would probably be a good idea.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,390
And with cookie I’ve been taking so many
photos of her,

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,149
this is probably full already. And then the
case on the back is by Rifle Paper

14
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,670
Company, I really liked the colors and that
it was really girly and I just really liked

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,579
the print. It was really pretty and I just
like to look at it!

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,180
Now onto the apps, let’s start with games. The game that I have been currently

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,639
playing is called Best Fiends, it’s a puzzle
adventure game. And I found it because

18
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:07,799
a lot of YouTubers were talking about it,
so I thought, huh, I better go

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,159
check it out! So I downloaded it, which, it’s
free, if you were wondering,

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,979
And it is so cute! I fell in love with it,
I’m addicted, I play it every day.

21
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,920
And even though I’m slower at video games…
I’m slow, but you know what it’s so cute.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,979
You start here at level 1, and then as you
complete the levels, you move through

23
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,009
the world dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh!

24
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,409
Level 38, I’m here in the North Pole, it’s
snowing and cold here.

25
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,899
Your little bug characters are trying to make
their way home to Mount Boom,

26
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:44,039
where their friends and family are, and you’re
defeating evil slugs.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,680
Look at these little bugs, they’re so cute,
because you can level them up,

28
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:51,380
and you unlock the characters as you're moving
through the levels, my favorite little

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,090
character is Howie. He’s the blue one!

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,999
And let me show you what a level looks like.
You have your little fiends over here,

31
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:03,029
your little buggies, and then over here on the
top left corner are your goals,

32
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:07,739
so the goal is to defeat 8 slugs and to set
off 1 bomb. Pfffft!

33
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,260
So, here’s your little slug and you can
see his health bar is right up above and

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,000
then you’re gonna connect, you can do all
these diagonals, deals damage to the

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,189
slug, dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh doom!

36
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,450
You can also connect to the game through Facebook
to see how far your friends

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,670
have gotten. You do not need an iPhone to
download this game, it’s available

38
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,629
on iPhone, iPad and Android. Alright, so that is the
game that I am playing and I’ll

39
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,629
put a link down below to everywhere that you
can download it, I personally love

40
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,799
this game, but I am warning you, it’s addictive!

41
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,049
Now, I’m gonna show you some of my favorite
educational apps.

42
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:45,849
The first app I’m gonna show you is the
one I use the most, I use it every night

43
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,769
to listen to books on tape before I go to
bed, and when I’m traveling.

44
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,989
It’s really good for when you're traveling and you want
to listen to a book on a plane,

45
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,689
sometimes you can fit in 2 books, and that
app is Audible.

46
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,010
For those of you who aren’t familiar with
Audible, it is an app where you can

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,069
download audio books and listen to them. And
if you’re like me and you have

48
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,159
difficulty reading, sometimes it’s really
helpful, I like to buy the physical copy of

49
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,459
the book, and then I listen along to Audible,
I went to twitter and I asked

50
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,930
you guys what book I should check out and I got so many suggestions, and 1 of them was the uglies series.

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,769
And that really intrigued me, so I looked it up,
and I got the book, and it’s a 4 part

52
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,170
series, set in a dystopian world. The first
book is called Uglies, and then theres

53
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,749
Pretties, Specials and Extras, and this book
is written from the perspective of

54
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:32,900
Tally, she’s the main character and she
is an Ugly, and apparently in this

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,989
community when you turn 16, you undergo a ton
of plastic surgery to become a Pretty.

56
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:44,230
Once you’re Pretty you enter the bigger
society and the idea behind that is everyone

57
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,959
looks the same so that there’s no discrimination.
And then the Specials are basically

58
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,079
genetically enhanced humans, they see better,
they run faster, their bones

59
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,159
don’t break. Extras, I don’t even know
what those are, I haven’t made it there

60
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,540
yet. I’ve really been enjoying this book,
so if you would like to check out Audible,

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,209
or read this book, you can go to  Audible.com/RosannaPansino, and you will get

62
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,909
a free Audiobook and a 30 day trial. The second
educational app that I’ve been using

63
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,549
a lot is called Duolingo and it’s free,
and it’s a really fun and easy way to learn

64
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:20,109
another language, I am currently trying to
teach myself Italian…. Hahahahaha.

65
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:24,860
I’m laughing because I’m a slow learner
but, I’m working, I’m working on it.

66
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,680
I wanted to learn Italian for 2 reasons, 1
is because I wanted to tap into my

67
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,050
Italian roots, I actually have family in Italy,
in Southern Italy, and when

68
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,550
I talk with them on Skype I have to have my
cousin translate. My mom is a dual

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,000
citizen, and I just never learned Italian,
so I thought it would be really

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,370
helpful to communicate with my own family.
Also, I’ve been singing a lot of

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,970
Opera lately and my voice coach recommended
that I learn Italian because it

72
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,930
will help with all the opera songs that I
love and I’ve been messing around with.

73
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,220
So, the little app for Duolingo is that cute
little green face. You just tap

74
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,240
on him and it gives you daily and basic lessons
and it’s really interactive.

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,009
It teaches you language in different exercises,
1 of the exercises is, the app

76
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,729
will say a word, “bebo”, means I Drink,
so then you have to type in here,

77
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,389
I, Drink, check! And then for these exercises,
they will say a phrase in another

78
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,120
language, and you hold down and repeat. it’s
kind of like talking to Siri, and

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,270
the program will determine whether you’re
pronunciating the words correctly.

80
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,860
“Yo so una dona”

81
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,039
“Yo so una dona”

82
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:31,900
Translation, I am a woman! That’s correct!

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,260
Anyways, I have been doing this a lot lately, I think it's really fun! 

84
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,460
And,  if you are looking to learn another language this will be a fun option for

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,750
you, and it’s free.

86
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,150
The last educational app I’m going to show
you is not 1 that I’m using every day,

87
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,949
but it is amazing, and I love it.

88
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:55,509
It is called Star Guide, it did cost me $1.99,
but I love space! If you love space,

89
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:00,560
this is just the coolest thing ever. So you
click on it, and the app uses GPS,

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,139
so this is where we are, and wherever you
turn it, it will show you all the

91
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,490
sky constellations, because 1 night, I was
out with my friends and I saw a

92
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,750
constellation and I said hey, that looks like
the big dipper. And they said theres

93
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,479
actually an app where you can see every constellation
and know what they are and

94
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,300
I said HUUUHHHHHHH!!!! HOW DO I NOT HAVE IT?!?!?!

95
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,860
The app is 360, so anywhere you point, whether
is’t below you, all around, you can

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,090
see every single star constellation.

97
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,349
Oh so romantic!

98
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,270
Those are all of my favorite current educational
apps, now let’s move on to

99
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,300
my favorite charity app. My favorite charity
app that I have been using almost

100
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,520
every day is an app called charity miles,
it’s really, really cool, so if you

101
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,819
are someone who walks, jogs, goes hiking or
bikes, this might be a really cool app

102
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,360
and a small way for you to give back every
day.

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,439
As some of you know, I go on a morning walk
every day, sometimes it’s a jog, but

104
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,120
it’s just to get the blood flowing, 1 or
2 miles every morning. And this apps

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,250
really cool, because what you do when you
open it, there’s a list of all these

106
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,680
different charities, and you can pick whatever
one you’d like. I usually choose

107
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,650
to donate to LLS, which is Leukemia and Lymphoma
Society, because as many of

108
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,479
you know, my dad was diagnosed with Leukemia
2 years ago, so anything that I can

109
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,960
do to help Leukemia research I’ll do!

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,840
And just to let you know, you are not donating
your own money, the money comes from

111
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,069
companies that they have partnered with.

112
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:25,220
So for every mile that you do, whether you’re
walking or jogging, they will donate

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,990
25 cents, and for every mile that you bike,
they will donate 10 cents.

114
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,470
It’s just a really small thing that you
can do to give back. And I thought, that

115
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,340
was really cool.

116
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,250
Alright, and now let’s move on to my 2 favorite
photo apps, the first is

117
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,479
Pic Stitch, I just started using this on my
Instagram, you guys may have noticed

118
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,039
this, I’m a little late to the photo game,
but, I love it because you can make

119
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:50,770
little collages of all your pictures. And say
you go out for a night on the town,

120
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,889
you go to an opera with your friends, and
you have like 3 or 4 photos that

121
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,300
really summarize the night, and you want to
post them all together so that

122
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,810
you don’t spam your friends’ feeds, so
you can make these little collages.

123
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,990
Here you just open the app and then there’s all
these different formatted layouts, and then

124
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,900
you pick your favorite, and you can drag pictures
in there from your camera,

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,800
from your photo album, and then post that
photo anywhere!

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,669
And it’s free, you can pay to upgrade for
different layouts and frames, but

127
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,090
I like the ones they provide because they
give you tons of options,

128
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,509
there are plenty! This app is pretty good!

129
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,800
The next photo app that I’ve been using
a lot is called Hyperlapse, it’s where you

130
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,790
take a 3 minute video and then it speeds it up,
if you guys remember on Instagram, I

131
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,840
posted a video, I actually tried it out when
our plane was taking off, and the

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,210
video was so smooth! If I would have done
that on my camera I think it would

133
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,320
have been really shaky!

134
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,820
To use the app it’s super simple, you just
open it up and then you hit this

135
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:56,820
to record, da-dew! And then… I’m just gonna record,
I'm gonna do this for about a minute.

136
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,410
And there you have it, there is your sped
up video that is stabilized,

137
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,350
and you can increase the speed if you like,
and then you hit check!

138
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,660
Then it’s saved and ready to share. Not
that I would want to share that video, it’s

139
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,450
not very interesting!

140
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,530
The last new app that I got on my phone is
called vocal warm up, and it is an

141
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,210
app that helps you warm up your vocal chords
before you sing so that you don’t

142
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,120
damage your voice.

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,140
I played with so many warm up apps, and this
was my favorite, by far.

144
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,660
I think it was $3.99, but it was worth it
because it was a really good one!

145
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,220
You can test your vocal range in the app, and then
depending on where you land.

146
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,270
I am a soprano. It has a ton of different
customized warm ups for someone

147
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,630
in your vocal range. And I thought this was
really cool!

148
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,590
So I go to my warmups, and I’ve downloaded
a few to practice so we have

149
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,600
the example warm up which comes with it, and
then 1 for Opera and then 1 just

150
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,840
for fun! Here’s an example of 1 of the warmups,
this is lip trill for a soprano,

151
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,180
so you just hit play…

152
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,500
Bbbbbbb-bbbbbb-bbbbbb-bbbbb-bbbb-bbbbb-bbbb!
Hahahaha it tickles your nose!

153
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,480
Alright, so that is vocal warmup, I just really
love this app because as you guys

154
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,450
know, I’ve been singing Opera for fun lately
and i just released my first original

155
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,970
song, so I’ve been singing a little bit
more, and it just helps to have a little

156
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,030
warmup near you so that you don’t hurt the
voice.

157
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,350
The last apps that I have on here are my basic
social medias, and I showed

158
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,760
you guys these ones last time, but yeah there’s
just Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube

159
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,210
and Creator Studio. If you are a YouTuber,
Creator Studio is a really good

160
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,210
app because it’s where you can go in to
your account and you can reply to

161
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,460
people, and it’s a lot easier to navigate
your own channel.

162
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,570
Twitter and then I have my Facebook Pages
because I don’t have a personal

163
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:42,450
Facebook page, I only use my public page,
so I always have my Facebook Pages

164
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,700
ready to go, so I can talk to you guys and
upload photos. And up here at the top

165
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:55,320
I’ve got my camera, the date, my app store,
music and iTunes, clock and calculator.

166
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:02,080
And then down here I like to keep my phone,
messages, email and my interwebz!

167
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,240
I hope you guys liked this video, I loved
showing you all the apps that I have

168
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,830
and I just wanted to give a big thank you
to Best Fiends and Audible for teaming

169
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,970
up with me on this video, this was so much
fun!

170
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,100
Let me know what your favorite apps are, and
if I should check out any of them.

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,700
Leave me a comment down below!

172
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,850
I’ve been getting a lot of requests to do
a room tour, my room is pretty boring,

173
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,290
right now it’s kinda like 50 Shades of Gray
looking… Well, it’s more like

174
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,180
3 shades of gray, that’s my comforter and
pillows, but, um… I moved in about a year

175
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,250
ago and I just don’t have a lot of stuff
in here yet. I’m working on it though.

176
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,250
Let me know if that’s something you’d
be into, I’ll work on it.

177
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,330
Alright, bye you guys. Bee-bee!

A few months ago, we posted Brooklyn's ""What's On My iPhone"" video! You guys loved it, so we filmed another one but for my (Bailey) iPhone! We are super appreciative to Best Fiends for partnering with us on this special phone tour video for y'all! 

Since we've worked with Best Fiends before, they decided to hide a treasure especially for OUR FANS in the game! It's our B&B logo, and you can find it vial the clue, ""Even as twins, we're not always speaking the same language""! Go see if you can find our hidden treasure!

Brooklyn is way more organized than I am, but today you'll get a deeper look into my personality by seeing what apps I keep on my iPhone, including those that I use the most! 

We do spend a lot of time on our YouTube and social media apps, as well as our CuteGirlsHairstyles app. I also love my scriptures app for early morning seminary and for at Church, and my Kindle app for recreational reading. I love to edit photos, so I go through my favorite app for that as well one that I use to track fashion trends. I only have one game on my phone... can you guess what it is??? Best Fiends!

💥SUPERFANS💥: Please help us translate this What's on Bailey's iPhone video, and get credit below! http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?v=prd9TIwQ038&ref=share

If you loved this iPhone tour video, be sure to give it a HUGE ""👍🏻"" and please leave a comment below telling us what level of Best Fiends you are on! I am now on level 67!

20
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,449
pictures and that's because I love

00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:52,909
pictures and then on the bottom I've got

22
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:55,370
my basic apps like my safari music email

23
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:57,170
and phone call app thingy and I'm not

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,149
even close to as organized as Brooklyn

25
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,620
is so I don't color code my stuff I just

26
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,179
put a little folders and that's about as

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,400
good as it's gonna get so I'm just gonna

28
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,440
show you all my folders today so I will

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,060
go ahead and open up my games folder as

30
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,460
you can family have one game on my phone

31
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,899
and it is best fiends as you guys know

32
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,310
our family has been having a huge

33
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:15,049
competition with this app and I am

34
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,670
definitely winning right now so

35
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,990
basically best fiends is a puzzle

36
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,360
adventure game where you collect an

37
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,130
upgrade characters and by doing this you

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,530
have two matchups and colored objects

39
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,960
and defeat the slugs so you guys can see

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,020
I am level 67 which means I am totally

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,180
beating my family right now oh yeah so

42
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,890
I'll kind of show you how it works while

43
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,450
I am talking about the game best fiends

44
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,310
decided to have a treasure hunt for the

45
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,020
next three weeks where they will hide 15

46
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,030
items within the game and if you find

47
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,189
all 15 hidden treasures you'll unlock a

48
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,689
giant reward at the end so Brooklyn and

49
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:46,430
I decided to hide our own little gift

50
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,100
inside the game and it will be our B&B

51
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,689
logo and our hint for that is even as

52
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,460
twins we're not always speaking the same

53
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,049
language and then on Friday we will be

54
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,460
tweeting out another hint that will help

55
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,350
you find a different treasure in the

56
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,880
game alright so this is my entertainment

57
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,289
folder as you can see I've got the

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,850
basics like social media and then I've

59
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,799
got the iTunes Store in the Apple Store

60
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,009
and one of the things that I use a ton

61
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,420
is Spotify and I swear by Spotify and my

134
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,550
ever because I love

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,600
- reads you guys can see some of the

136
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,240
books that I've been reading this summer

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,460
on here and then I also have just a

138
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,810
remote app for Apple TV because I lose

139
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,700
remote all the time all the time

140
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,410
literally all the time I could never

141
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,210
find it and then I have my Sonos app

142
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,490
which is like another music playing app

143
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,960
and now it is time for my reference app

144
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,700
so this is where I keep all my school

145
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,220

Google Docs for power school gotta keep

147
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,760
up with those grades and then I have the

148
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,720
Weather Channel app because I like to

149
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,330
know what's happening with the weather

150
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,460
and then LDS tools is just another

151
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,410
Church app and then my chase banks at

and figure out what's what's happening

154
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,810
over there and then you guys can see

155
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,220
that I have a clue up Brooklyn also had

156
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,290
this app on her phone and it basically

157
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,640
just helps me track my periods that I

158
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,840
know when it's happening and all that

159
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,540
craziness that happens during the

160
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,010
womanhood and then here's my guitars tab

161
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,050
app which is what I use when I'm playing

162
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,700
on cameras guitar to tune it how to

163
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,070
check out songs or whatnot and also I

164
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,410
can use it for my ukulele and last but

165
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,700
not least here is my last folder so I'm

166
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,980
gonna start off with the app Yelp

167
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,630
basically you type in a store slash

168
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,190
restaurant and it will find the closest

169
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,840
one to you and give you directions which

170
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,340
is really helpful for me because I get

171
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,080
lost a lot because I never know where

172
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,620
anything is so I definitely use that all

173
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,480
the time

174
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,310
and then here is my studying app it just

175
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,080
keeps me on track and times for how long

176
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,570
I've been studying and the longer I

177
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,250
study the bigger my tree will grow so I

178
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,860
use this all the time just to keep me on

179
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,500
track during the school year now here is

180
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,420
one of my favorite apps it's called post

181
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,700
mate I use this when I'm traveling

182
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,070
around like in the u.s. mostly when I go

183
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,630
to LA and it's basically like a delivery

184
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,980
system where they will pick up your food

185
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,260
and deliver it to you so it's really

186
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,150
nice and then here I've got my style

187
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,040
book app array keep all my fashion

188
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,410
inspiration ideas in here because you

189
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,390
guys know I'm a fashionista and I love

190
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,130
my clothing in my fashion so I'll just

191
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,810
put in my inspiration in there and then

192
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,060
I'll reference it later and then this is

193
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,670
my bin app so whenever I go anywhere to

194
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,530
travel internationally or in the US I

195
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,270
will type in a place that I go and this

196
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,070
being app will help me just keep track

197
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,830
of how many places I've been and will

198
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,510
percentage of the world I have seen so

199
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,190
that is my phone in a nutshell as you

200
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,560
can see I only have five folders and

201
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,870
then

202
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,430
main screen so there y'all go and now

203
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm gonna describe my case for y'all so

204
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,870
I just have a plain black mokey case and

205
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,520
I love my mokey and if you guys don't

206
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,010
know what a mokey is basically it's like

207
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,990
a portable charger so what I do is I

208
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,190
flip this little button to green and

209
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,080
then I press the button on the other

210
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,690
side and it will begin charging my phone

211
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,340
and then here is my home screen as you

212
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,050

I had loads of fun filming these oddly satisfying moments and I'd love to make more ""most satisfying"" videos like this. If you have any suggestions for strangely satisfying DIY moments then just leave them in the comments below :D.","1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,280
Hi everyone!

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,020
Many people tell me that my videos help them against anxiety, and i'm really happy to hear that.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:15,900
So I decided to make this extra special countdown featuring the most oddly satisfying DIY moments.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,700
Needless to say, this video is super relaxing to watch and I really hope you'll enjoy it.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,940
Some of you know that I decided to close my online shop in order to focus completely on YouTube.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,740
Now I actually have time to make twice as many videos for all you wonderful subscribers.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,060
However, the online shop was a key source of income for me, so I hope you guys can understand why I might have to take on more paid work for YouTube in the future.

8
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,960
So that's why I'll just say thank you to Best Fiends for sponsoring this video.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,740
This is a free, puzzle-battle game where you can unlock tons of characters and build a team to defeat the evil slugs.

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,380
I know you're thinking that YouTubers have to say good things about the game because their obviously sponsored,

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,240
but in all honesty, after I downloaded and started playing Best Fiends I became completely addicted because this game is seriously so much fun.

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,440
You'll have to trust me and try the game out yourself, and you realize how incredibly satisfying it is to complete huge combos like this.

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,740
You'll also discover loads of new levels and side quests based on the most popular characters.

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:29,020

far into the game but I like playing it

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,450
because it's challenging and it makes me

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,940
have to think of different ways of doing

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,520

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,600
or something and it's actually become a

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,610
thing where I take my phone to the

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,140
toilet if I'm going for a poop to play

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,750

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:38,909

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:41,579
about ten and now i can't sleep yay and

32
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,720
I did have my dog here with me but he

33
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,640
left he laid with me further around and

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,850
when my brain decided you're going to

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,820
finish writing a poem then he was like

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:02:01,320

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,099

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,560
seen by someone than no one and then

48
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,319
people say don't apologize for this it's

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,700

50
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,530
don't apologize then the odds are not

51
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,580
going to be very good and it's not gonna

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,970
be very well received and then next time

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:55,760
I will have to put something on saying

54
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,760
you know this is that don't judge me

55
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,580
I'll Yan the fact that sort unsubscribed

56
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,659
when I released my last video that

57
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:10,349
really did wonders for my conference so

58
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:11,700
yay I guess I don't know if this is

59
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,550
going to turn out to be anything

60
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,500
interesting but I just felt like

61
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:24,180
recording another video after the code

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:27,540
to do some talking really maybe you'll

63
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,120
capture me doing this if I'd leave this

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,019
level warrants on me that's going in the

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:39,239

66
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:42,180
with my blog and what I do is I write a

67
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,659
poem usually I instead of putting it

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,879
here I just write it up put in my blog

69
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:52,170
and then I complain when I don't have

70
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:57,030
fear your ideas like you an idiot

71
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:59,879
Kenneth you have an idea when you put it

72
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,700
elsewhere I mean obviously I want to

73
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,370
share content between the two but it's

74
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,030
like every video I do but I have an idea

75
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,030

side I had simple things like an eraser

55
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:10,200
this is like the standard type of the

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,360
erasers in Japan it's dirt cheap big and

57
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,600
lasts a long time and I say I just lie

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,430
Bruce simply transfer on a ruler which

59
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,030

but have a very sweet passport color

68
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,580

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,250
look at as I have a to-do list which

70
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,230

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:37,200
so for this I have a ring holder a

106
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,800
folder edit and that's not just some wet

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,320
it's cute wet

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:47,310
before make here to our Father alphas

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:51,540
active auroral bow take care of Japanese

110
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:55,260
retune and it says I will be I'm hanging

111
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,540
it is actually cute but our hands will

112
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:05,930
obviously get too heavy to carry around

113
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:08,190
so I also got it it's trying to fly away

114
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,060
sitting to spring the season of cherry

115
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:16,260

file folder pink and super girly back to

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,080
be honest I bought it more because I

118
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:26,190
like how it contains multiple to your

119
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,830
files one clear file which you can close

120
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,320

125
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,290

Many people have requested an ASMR slime DIY so I hope you'll enjoy this!! I've been following lots of DIY slime Instagram accounts and began noticing many ""new"" slime styles pop up. These include using foam balls, mixing clear DIY slime with white DIY slime, pearly effects or adding polymer clay cane slices.

Of course you CAN substitute borax solution for the contact lens liquid. If you do that, you can skip the baking soda as well. (Baking soda is used to create alkaline pH conditions in the glue. This ""activates"" the sodium borate inside eye drops or contact lens solution which causes the PVA to clump together, thus creating slime. So you've effectively ""made"" borax using baking soda and eye drops...which is why these two things need to be used together in DIY slime recipes)

The brands of clear glue that definitely work for DIY slime are Elmer's Glue (USA), Povinal (Asia), Pelikan Pelifix (Germany, Austria), AMOS (Korea, USA) and Pritt Craft Glue (UK). These are just the countries I know of, so they may well be sold in other places too! Trying searching each brand online and you'll be able to see if the deliver to you. I bought my eye drops form Pearle Optik and the contact lens solution and facewash from DM.","1

Hi everyone!

00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,760
and think many of you know

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,920
I decided to re-create 5 of the most amazing Instagram slimes

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,760
using a method that doesn't require any borax, liquid starch or detergent.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,800
As always I'm using supplies that can be bought or ordered from any country

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,140
so just check the description box for all the links.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,900
This video is sponsored by Best Fiends

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,940
and it's no secret that I'm a huge fan of the game.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,080
So, of course, I jumped at the chance to help them announce a brand, new game

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,380
called Best Fiends Forever.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,240
This is the latest game from the Best Fiends trilogy

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,180
featuring the same characters but, as you can see here,

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,900
the gaming style is completely different.

15
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,620
It's an addictive, clicker adventure game where you can slap your way through the levels

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,580
whilst collecting treasures and upgrading your team.

17
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,280
It's very fast paced so you'll need quick reactions to defeat the enemy slugs.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,500
I love the fact that the music and characters are so familiar yet this game is full of action.

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,740
So be sure to download it for free using the link below this video

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,080
and let me know how far you can get.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,340
Thank you so much for listening to this intro and let's get started with the slime.

22
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,180

today we are doing something that I

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,300
wanted to do for a very long time but I

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,070
haven't really been confident enough to

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,980
share it a lot of you lovelies have been

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,139
requesting a bedtime routine and we

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,869
thought we'd bless your presence with it

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,760
Oh bless you with your present yeah this

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:25,350
video is gonna be very ASMR but one

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,510
thing I'd like to share with you guys is

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,260
that I really enjoyed making this video

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,090
so here we are

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,790
average day we just come back into the

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,020
flat and take a moment to appreciate

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,219
Sammy will lock the door because we live

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,469
in London and that's just a good thing

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,820
to do we like take stock of the day and

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,410
I like to bring home everything I've

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,809
been caring with me that day so in this

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,550
instance emotional package our flat

20
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,500
leads straight into the kitchen and here

21
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,600
we like to take stock further than

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,079
appreciate a day I like to light every

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,350
candle I have I've got about 450 I put

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,359
about 25 on the table here so whilst

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,129
Mickey's doing that I like to put way

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,379
all the bits I bought that day such as

27
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,650
premium-grade quinoa or other knots

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,990
impulses that cost too much and I also

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:15,750
like to take stock here again of my day

30
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:17,790
off in the fridge I've got a lot of

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,229
emotion attached to food I like to store

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,960
things here such as mine massive

33
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:27,960
self-loathing lack of appreciation for

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,840
myself so I'm a bit simple so it takes a

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,700
lot out if you are wondering why we have

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,310
all this alcohol in the fridge it's

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,229
because we are lowlifes discussing

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,500
lowlifes once I've had such a busy day I

39
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,990
just need to switch off and yes I play

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,329
games so again I've been playing for the

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,040
last year and honestly I haven't got

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,270
very far on is Best Fiend

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,189
which is treated I'm opening the App

44
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,829
Store the game itself is easy to play

45
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,869
which for me is a bonus unlike the game

46
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,470
itself is stupidly addictive because it

47
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,960
is stupidly easy all you need

48
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,150
is linked up the same color item and

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,620
it'll boost your little theme to attack

50
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,240
the slugs which are taking over the

51
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,920
world by the way if you didn't realize

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,250
the world itself is called my new tier

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,170
just in case you 159 and you have to

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,960
battle the slugs and rescue of your

55
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,170
beans as you go along with keys nick is

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,570
actually uses the games are you know as

57
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,730
seen here I'm past level 30 which owned

58
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,870
we all know is it indicator of skill

59
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:29,440
finesse and ability honed in I think by

60
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,850
my diet of nuts and victory also you can

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,590
go on a really cute personal journey

62
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,300
with your favorite Best Fiend which I

63
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,640
like to do every morning and every

64
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,290
evening and doing here it makes me feel

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,959
like I'm growing as a person and these

66
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,970
slugs they are a metaphor for all of the

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,459
strife that I had in my life be that

68
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,620
actual rule slugs or when you burn your

69
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,200
tongue like taking a sip of coffee or

70
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,140
tea a little bit too hot that's where it

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,840
might smell so I I really enjoy playing

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,270
this and it fits so easily into my

73
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,950
nighttime routine Best Fiend is giving

74
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,530
away an in-game gift tomorrow that's

75
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,140
Sunday June 19th and I mean who doesn't

76
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,940
like free things am i right you can take

77
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,380
the boy out of Essex but you can't take

78
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,090
the S example boys and they're roaming

79
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,250
me so now I'm back in the kitchen my

80
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,750
Haven and I like to throw together a

81
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,670
really healthy meal so my go-to at the

82
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:17,800
moment is a single cherry tomato a

83
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,750
carrot that's slightly brown and just

84
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,010
cough the top fun fact

85
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,290
Sammy's only been allowed to use knives

86
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,209
since moving out anyway sometimes I like

87
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,470
to find some random items that add a

88
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,750
little weight should depth of flavor

89
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,030
here we have a banana with a skin and

90
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,860
I'm going to grab some other bits now

91
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,930
just a little hint of my favourite

92
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,330
tipple here and a bit of that and we

93
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,799
didn't have any keen were in the house

94
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,810
but so we went for porridge oats and if

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,510
I'm feeling super cheap my do use a

96
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,280
cashew nut but not the whole not just an

97
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,810
in there we go

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,850
naughty and then we nuke it in the

99
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,269
microwave and then bang bang bang here

100
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,269
is the pop

101
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,129
okay and then after I've had a very

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,769
filling meal I like to head upstairs to

103
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:12,150
my safe other safe haven as a youtuber

104
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,769
Sammy has absolutely no muscle mass is

105
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,180
actually the way because he sits in

106
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,459
front of computer all times

107
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,519
anyway Sammy's nighttime routine we need

108
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,190
hushed tones as I explained that the

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,000
evening routine so here's me in the

110
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,610
bathroom

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,389
I take stock of my day again for the

112
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,789
fifth time and I I inspect my skin for

113
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:35,729
the perfections I didn't really have a

114
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,539
skincare routine okay that's really

115
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,510
creepy go away

116
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,100
Sammy especially the face of water

117
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,080
liberally as you can see pulling a weird

118
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,979
face because he's got a gross face in

119
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,430
Easter covering water

120
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:49,710
this is distilled water from the para

121
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,229
the Pope the Sahara rather than these

122
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,270
sponges and other artificial creations

123
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:56,160
that can little the planet Sam uses a

124
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,840
whole elaborate plant just as just to

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,430
braise the skin and scrub away all those

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,080
dead skin cells and if you're bleeding

127
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,330
that means you've done it well and then

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,449
I like to ingest little and then dry my

129
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:12,380
face summing them brushes each tooth

130
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:15,180
individually using the hair of a unicorn

131
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,740
and then Sammy locks the back door

132
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,750
double checks it three times as we do

133
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,699
live in London and that's crucial if I'm

134
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,669
in the mood do attempt Romberg on myself

135
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,199
just to see if it's effective or not so

136
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:29,699
as we can see that most effective and

137
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,690
now that everything's ready it's time

138
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,000
for the fun part

139
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,000
and that that happens in the bedroom

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,260
Netflix Oh Sammy watches Netflix until

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,780
these early hours of the morning and

142
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,090
we'll commit to going to bed probably

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,560
around 4:00 a.m. you don't they say if

144
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,150
you can't hear the birds it's not ready

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,510
for bed if you're not out the race you

146
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,510
can't lose

147
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:54,800

new kids are just lucky these days sure

39
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,730
I had to walk to school both ways when I

40
00:01:54,710 --> 00:02:00,050
was growing up in the snow walk all

41
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,250
right we know this is authentic as when

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,220
I looked inside of it when we're moving

43
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:08,110
it this fell out it's all eaten up by

44
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:11,420
some kind of animal or insect pac-man

45
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,900
December 1980 this is legit this is

46
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,190
old-school it's like an operating manual

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,989
that's so cool we have the original

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,370
thing I'm going to take this thing and

49
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:23,510
put it aside we don't want to cut this

50
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,070
guy open the sad thing to destroy this

51
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,600
piece of history this side of it has

52
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,580
really cool artwork we're going to try

53
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,870
to salvage this and keep it and also on

54
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,730
the other side maybe some of the stuff

55
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,989
from this panel but really we're just

56
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,180
gonna cut it right down the middle

57
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,970
this isn't ultra ultra rare like if you

58
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,190
wanted to get one

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,260
things they resell for around a thousand

60
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,400
a $2,000 this one's in good condition

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:57,300
but it's not like in the greatest

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:59,550
condition it's time to do this buddy so

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,470
check out the inside of it I really like

64
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,000
there's the miss pac-man this is how it

65
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,530
lights up you've got light bulbs just

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,360
like right there just your old-fashioned

67
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,220
light bulbs here's the speaker that's on

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,000
the top of the box and look at this pale

69
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,100
border here oh yeah oh yeah that's

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
pretty wild look at all this I'm gonna

71
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,470
keep this like let us know in the

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,630
comments what should we do with this

73
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,980
thing I've got a few ideas of some

74
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,570
youtubers I could give it to and maybe

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,570
they could do something unique with it I

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,680
cut across this top part right here

77
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,380
nothing we got miss pac-man logo off

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,090
grab it look at that we got it movie is

79
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,680
just like glass we're gonna give it away

80
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,150
look in the description we'll figure out

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,650
some way to give it to somebody but that

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,650
is cool good job

83
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,010
light bulbs for safety I'm gonna take

84
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,010
those guys out of there throw them away

85
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,000
well that's not good it's totally broken

86
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,380
what do you want to see where the screen

87
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:24,320
looks like one of these things check it

88
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,850
out this is one of the oldest TVs you'll

89
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,350
ever see in your life see that that's

90
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,690
the bottom of the TV right there that's

91
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,580
the bottom of the TV just like you

92
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,740
basically just have a TV monitor inside

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,230
of the machine one thing I like to is if

94
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,590
you look down here look at this whole

95
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,990
setup battery some kind of amplifier for

96
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,000
that for the energy well this is where

97
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,200
the manual was see how it's all you can

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,150
see the piece of the manual maybe it

99
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,510
wasn't bugs maybe it was just time

100
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,230
wearing it down oh look at that guy

101
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:58,640
that's really cool

102
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:02,600
don't break it oh look at this this has

103
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,390
been played so much over the years that

104
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,320
you can see imprinted in it look at that

105
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,540
do you see that high score it's etched

106
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,500
into the screen this thing is not

107
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,260
powered on right now

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,760
that's pretty rad this is where the

109
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,220
quarters going right here see Lincoln

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,510
just opened it up hey buddy hey so when

111
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,620
they open this up they can just reach in

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,230
there about

113
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:27,110
no quarters put a rip off any hidden

114
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:30,470
under there well look look what's hidden

115
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,970
under there the key we found the key all

116
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,560
right I need this TV out of here I want

117
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:36,020
to take this panel off we're losing

118
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,390
daylight here unlike the TV that we cut

119
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,770
open on this driveway I really hope this

120
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,070
thing doesn't explode everywhere but

121
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,070
we'll see

122
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,070
okay yeah

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,770
this is one thing my daughter asked for

124
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,690
the actual keyboard look at this look

125
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,480
how cool that is when I turn the

126
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,360
joystick has this ball that goes around

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,330
and pushes the different levers oh man

128
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:10,770
that is super duper cool we'll keep this

129
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:12,960
board these guys on it it's a heavy one

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,110
that's where all the weight is on this

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,729
guy my guy

132
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,300
do you see that looks more like an

133
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,300
atomic bomb

134
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:26,970
all right Lincoln with no fat TV we got

135
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,970
a graveyard down here

136
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,540
some of our favorite parts the joystick

137
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,070
the friend controller this chipboard

138
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,510
that is still completely intact

139
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,220
so somebody heat an extra chipboard

140
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,170
around I think I have somebody that

141
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,430
might want this this one right here if

142
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,720
you guys want this we'll put something

143
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,700
in the description to give this away to

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,420
one of you if you want it I think it's

145
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,040
pretty cool

146
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,340
miss pac-man logo on there it's glass

147
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,930
this one is definitely my favorite I

148
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:58,270
like it I like the artwork on it the

149
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:59,800
giant TV monitor atomic bomb we should

150
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,290
probably break that TV don't you think

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,110
see what's inside of that TV hold on a

152
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,270
second my dad's grabbing a sledgehammer

153
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,550
this one's to all of you that played

154
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,680

games and can never beat the thing and

156
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,230
you're always a little upset you just

157
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,310
wish you could just bang through the

158
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,310
glass this is for you

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:27,140
[Music]

160
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:29,510
oh yeah that glass is an inch thick it's

161
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,840
like ice it's like giant pieces of ice

162
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,880
from a lake oh there's all that dust

163
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,830
right so pretty oh no it's silver it's

164
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,780
silver on the inside that's meant to be

165
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,390
like that yeah don't breathe that stuff

166
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,830
in look at this this is some kind of

167
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:47,000
metal wiring inside of the de stream

168
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,500
what even is this do you guys know if

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,960
you've seen these on tvs before

170
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,000
look how stinking cool that is it's like

171
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,900
these copper wires this is the way I

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,420
call it the bomb

173
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,290
that is the bomb part super rad I think

174
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,580
we need to buy another one of these for

175
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,620

176
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,790

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,080
lot of fun we got stuff open so you

178
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,310

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:21,600
a little season I was so nearly so

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:22,650
stoked oh hi sisters dreams Charles here

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:30,539
and welcome back to my youtube channel

4
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:31,560
so I've been so busy lately doing so

5
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,730
many different shoots and so we

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,380
different projects that I have really

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,149
had any time to get a creative look done

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,350
so today I really wanted to sit down and

9
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,420
throw something together that was cool

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,920
and conceptual it is officially February

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,140
which means this month is Valentine's

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,670
Day I'm not excited it is my Luther

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,860
holiday because I've been single for it

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,210
for 17 years now and let's be real it's

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,100
going to be 18 in just a few days

16
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,239
because unfortunately I will not be

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,890
sharing this special day with anybody

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,539
special and I'll be staying at home I

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,699
thought I would do a more non wearable

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,520
look so today I created this super fun

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,420
glittery pink inspired valentine's day

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,040
luck with hearts it's cute I don't know

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,030

face using my eighth benefit

Porefessional primer as always if by

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,060
a whole lot of sweaty and a whole lot of

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,790
excited the last thing you want to do is

pre-primary nose like usual and it is so

39
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,869
my favorite trick but I lost my Mac

40
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,490
concealer that I always used for it and

41
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:38,070
I've been way too lazy to buy any one so

42
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,720
yeah as always I'm gonna use my guitar

43
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,619
shape to concealer to conceal and

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,619
highlight my face

exact routine literally 50 million times

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,819
you all know I don't really like to

49
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:55,140
switch out my products and as I look at

50
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:57,149
super intricate so I want to make sure

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,799
all the focus is teaching guys how to

52
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,780
achieve this valentine's day look

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,579

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,599
about five to ten minutes and while that

62
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,220

63
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,690
my brows but today I want to show you

64
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,579

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,370
youtubers have talked about it so major

69
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,730
shadows Christian for sponsoring this

70
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,500
video

71
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,480
when they originally reached out I was

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,829
like no thank you and then I actually

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,049
download the app and started playing and

74
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:45,269
then I was like oh you know what yes

75
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,950
thank you this is so fun and not even

76
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,959
gonna lie I've been playing it non-stop

77
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,329
Bessie's is a free adventure puzzle game

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,090
where you connect objects of the same

79
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,650
color to jesus loves you guys all man

80
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,329
sat out your hear me sauce all the times

81
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,920
out like escape rooms and like wanting

82
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,510
to escape from prison one day and all

83
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,220
this weird type of stuff I know I'm

84
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,560
weird but I like thinking and using

85
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,359
strategy so this game is literally so

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,709
much fun for me since it is February and

87
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:08,970
this is a Valentine's Day tutorial I

88
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,190
thought this would be perfect to mention

89
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,599
this entire month up until February 26

90
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,370
there will be a Valentine's Day themes

91
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,780
characters and all types of puzzles that

92
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,400
you can solve and there's going to be a

93
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,900
special types of Valentine's Day as well

94
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,910
so make sure you play it then I'm

95
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,380
probably on at level 34 that I just

96
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,819
sorted playing a few days ago so I think

97
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,049
I'm doing it pretty well so far

98
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:26,190
and if you want to check it out the link

99
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,109
will be in the description below to

100
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,910
download for free like I said I really

101
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,590
been playing non-stop so let see if you

102
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,090
guys can beat my level comment down

103
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,099
below how far you are and good luck

104
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,599
sisters and may have got a little bit

105
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,859
distracted but at least I beat the level

106
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,090
but now that the Vegas all done I'm

107
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:40,590
going to go ahead and just wipe it off

108
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,769
so we can move on with the rest of the

109
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,150
face to start my brows today I'm going

110
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,560
to use a benefit processing my brow

111
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,560
pencil in the shade at number 6

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,770
I've been doing my brows a lot more like

113
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,540
light and fluffy lately with the pencil

114
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,120
as opposed to my usual honest al vog

115
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,310
brow and honestly I'm kind of like

116
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,970
loving it so maybe we're saying goodbye

117
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:13,130
to the James Charles brick of an eyebrow

118
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:14,390
RIT she will maybe be mad with this new

119
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,430
style of brawl that I've been loving

120
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,370
lately as I said I like to kind of fill

121
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,959
them in as least as possible and just

122
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,250
shape them and then I'll use the gel to

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,680
kind of brush the hair upwards and then

124
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,040
fill in any gaps that I have to take

125
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,500
them look really light fluffy and like

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,780
natural and then depending my eyelid in

127
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,520
place using my morphe e45 brush and some

128
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,720
more tarts tape tape concealer and then

129
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,140
just going over with my translucent

130
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,060
powder just off my eyes today I'm going

131
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,890
to be using my very very damaged violet

132
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,990
balls wholly realized shadow colors I'm

133
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,760
first going to talk with my m4 for one

134
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,020
tubing into a why ensign and putting

135
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,020
that in my crease as a transition color

136
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,620
I'm just putting this in my crease in

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,970
circular motions and when I get to the

138
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,160
outer corner I'm also going to pull this

139
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:03,290
eye shadow out and up in it like a

140
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,270
outward the winged e shape next going to

141
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,680
grab an M 4-3-3 on the same shade wine

142
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,070
and dine and deepen up my crease and

143
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,070
outer V

144
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,430
I'm also dragging whatever the excess

145
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,720
product is on this brush into the lower

146
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,160
lash line because we're going to have a

147
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,050
lot of stuff going on down here and then

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,070
to Hima em for for one with no pass on

149
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,070
and just blending out those edges

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,150
I'm next I'm about to shade a teddy bear

151
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,780
on the same brush and deepen up that

152
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,780
outer corner

153
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,650
that's going to take my 35b and my m56

154
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,900
to would zip that into that blood shade

155
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,550
just to define the very very outer part

156
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,840
very super gentle and light with this to

157
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,470
be careful but it doesn't get too dark

158
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,300
and messy

159
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,410
this look is taking a whole lot of

160
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,300
blending and for some reason my eye

161
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,730
shadow is not being cooperative today I

162
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,530
mean a really surprised will ever be a

163
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,750
video with James Charles where something

164
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,330
doesn't go wrong honestly probably not

165
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,220
clearly it's not this fun to do a half

166
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,380
cut crease today I'm going to use my m17

167
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,380
0.0 and this world pink shade on my lid

168
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,300
after got my glitter glue at home

169
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,340
classic James so I just use my eyelash

170
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,320
glue and some craft store glitter both

171
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,090
things that are typically not safe and

172
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,190
just did this house cut crease I would

173
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,630
not recommend that strategy I would

174
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,310
definitely recommend using regular glue

175
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,440
and cosmetic spray glitter but when

176
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,570
you're me sometimes things don't always

177
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,610
work out for the lower-left-hand I'm

178
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,350
going back in with my m4 for one and the

179
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,930
same shade wine and dine from the violet

180
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:56,930
vodka and I'm going to start to blow out

181
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:58,370
that bottom shadow I'm also making sure

182
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,450
to connect that pink up to the upper

183
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,220
lash line X I'm going to grab a teddy

184
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,150
bear on the m4 33 and deep enough that

185
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,150
outer corner

186
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,230
and I'm of the 562 in the block on the

187
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,740
35 B I'm going to just how to be at

188
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,740
lashline

189
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,250
so the lower lash a time to be gluing on

190
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,260
all sorts of different styles of glitter

191
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,850
I'm going to use this really pink fine

192
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,950
glitter pink little bit a little bit

193
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,340
more chunky and indeed pink heart

194
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,340
sequins

195
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:55,180
oh my god this is pretty uh I sort of

196
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,650
have in mind my upper and lower

197
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,690
waterline using my NYX jumbo eye pencil

198
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,980
in black bean to make the losses blend

199
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,050
together then I'm just going to get

200
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,580
Miami 213 in the black shade from the 35

201
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,130
B just make sure there's no skin showing

202
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,510
between the waterline and the lash line

203
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,370
alright guys that is when I all complete

204
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,330
of course obviously a - the lashes I'm

205
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,010
going to do is the one off camera

206
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,090
quickly to save some time then we can

207
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,250
finish up with the rest of the face

208
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,780
alright there we go that is the finis I

209
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,790
look for lashes today I'm going to pop

210
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,790
on the Lily lashes in the style of Janet

211
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,580
okay so I just found a video with Tana

212
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,960
mojo and I found out that apparently I'm

213
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,229
like the only person in human history

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,090
that puts on mascara ten lashes so today

215
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,530
I just did lashes and over the Pala

216
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,630
mascara to blend them together and that

217
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,820
was the easiest and eyewash should ever

218
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,560
go onto my eye and I'm very very angry

219
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,430
that I did not know this sooner the

220
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,900
amount of times that I've been putting

221
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,460
on a lot and it literally felt like 20

222
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,240
minutes so you know gluing it down a

223
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,590
million times

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,290
oh wow I feel betrayed I feel like who I

225
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,120
feel left out like I read all of my

226
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,440
comments and letting out a single lot of

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,180
you has ever come with his saying Oh

228
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,280
James you should try to put on your

229
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,050
eyelash first and then do mascara for

230
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,010
because it'll make your life a million

231
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,870
times a year instead of sending

232
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,300
seventeen years putting them on for once

233
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,800
you sisters have let me down in life

234
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,540
however stronger so off with my Anasazi

235
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,430
moonchild palette in the shade pink art

236
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,320
using my morphe M 501 remember you can

237
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,150
use code James for 10% off all morphe

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,830
products and then I go layer over top

239
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,270
using my star crush little palette or in

240
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,190
the shade rosy future and you can use

241
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,230
coded jeans for 50% off all their

242
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,640
products I'm also going to use the same

243
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,640
highlighter can highlight detect my nose

244
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,190
for less today I can be using the ofra

245
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:38,790
liquid lipstick in the shade of the guna

246
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:40,290
Beach never mind okay I take it back

247
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,370
okay let's try this again I'm going

248
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,760
using more free liquid lipstick in the

249
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,080
shade

250
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:50,460
now I don't like this one either well

251
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,200
last time I'm going to use Santa Anna

252
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,380
from Oprah hopefully this color will be

253
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,380
it

254
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,570
honestly whatever at this point hearing

255
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,060
them I still hate this let so I'm going

256
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,079
to layer the shade Angeles on top at

257
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:17,240
this point I don't know where we're

258
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:18,800
going with this honestly just like

259
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,560
giving up but I think this is the best

260
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,060
we're probably going to get today we're

261
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,560
done I just put on those two little

262
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,420
lipsticks then I added that highlighter

263
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,010
on top from star-crossed minerals and a

264
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,480
little bit of glitter no busy words

265
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,279
let's look anyways somewhere just go all

266
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,630
out and be extra and I'm going to set

267
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,850
this in place with my all their settings

268
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,810
right because after all this I do not

269
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:44,750
want this to come off

270
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:46,010
I think Urban Decay send me a message

271
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,449
that they want this to come off because

272
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:51,860
I just ran out of things oh god all

273
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,449
right guys and this is the completed

274
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,070

00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,700
good morning YouTube and welcome back to

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,670
my channel today is Monday June 13 and I

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,279
am going back to America basically I'm

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,260
going back for summer vacation in short

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,359
I haven't seen my family in a year when

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,490
I had Christmas break this year I had a

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,460
lot of exams around it so there was no

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,050
time to go home and so I stayed in Italy

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,580
and I haven't seen my family since last

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,590
summer and I missed them and I think

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,890
they missed me too first I was like what

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,870
am I going to do in America or do and a

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,000
half month but then I said this could be

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,950
an opportunity I mean all of this time

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
my channels pretty much been showing

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,719
Italy to the outside i showing italy

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,850
from an outsider's perspective but now

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,590
that I have so many Italian subscribers

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,870
I feel like a lot of Italians want to

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,489
know what is up with America so I just

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,070
wanted to like up Yuka update you guys

22
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,199
because if you follow me on Instagram or

23
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,120
Facebook or Twitter those things you

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,190
would have known all of this already but

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,519
just in case you don't I didn't want you

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,900
to see my next video in America and just

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,900
say to you what the heck

28
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,270
I can never ever find the right word

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,540
International Travel is never fun in

30
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,140
addition to a ton of anxiety late

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:42,100
flights lost luggages you end up having

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,370
to spend hours and hours just waiting so

33
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,110
how did I pass the time with an app if

34
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,060
you spend any amount of time on YouTube

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:51,580
you've probably already heard of this

36
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,500
app because it is everywhere the app

37
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,420
that I'm talking about is best fiends

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,550
and they recently reached out to me to

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,800
give their game a try the game is

40
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,920
essentially a puzzle matching game with

41
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,310
different characters levels challenges

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,160
goals and you just have to beat them all

43
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,380
I was really surprised at how addicting

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,950
it is you guys I can't stop playing I'm

45
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,900

kept me occupied the whole day and it

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,739
was really amazing because it even

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,560
worked without internet I was able to

49
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,870

I had the pleasure to work with Best Fiends for this video! I decided to paint the land of Minutia along with some of my favourite fiends. They're having a well deserved rest and fun time after freeing their families and the rest of Minutia from the slug pest that took over after the meteorite struck Mount Boom. 

Temper is so mesmerized by that strawberry and the whole strawberry patch. Bob is having fun seeing how entranced his fiend is. Kwincy is rejoicing in the scent of mellow flowers while Labbit is overly eager because he can see home from the top of the tree. Howey is waiting for the rest to be ready to start their journey back home, now as heroes and best fiends.

PS. Mount Boom seems to be pleased to be back to normal!

From the Green Glades to the foothills of Mount Boom

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,640
the small creatures of Minutia lived in harmony, until the night the meteor struck…

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,540
The meteor smashed into Mount Boom, bringing with it a strange force

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:26,320
that transformed the Slugs who lived there into an army of greedy, greenery-gobbling pests

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,920
that are now taking over the world.

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,460
But a brave band of heroes is fighting back!

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,980
Left behind when the Slugs captured their families, these unlikely champions are

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,020
on an epic quest to save their parents and beat back the Slug advance.

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,040

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,520

41
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,580
some of your suggestions from the last

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,500
video

43
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,080
a lot of you guys suggested I make a

44
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,410
pool so I can do that that's nice and

45
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,850
easy

46
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,330
and I don't even have to cheat for that

47
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:39,050
so let's go back to survival game mode

48
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,570
I think it's zero yep

49
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:45,670
alright so what I'm gonna need to do for

50
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:50,360
this is make sure that I have at least

51
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:52,640
cobblestone what can I make yeah I have

52
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,920
tons of cobblestone so I'm gonna make a

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,580
cobble just cobblestone pool I can't

54
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,810
talk right now

55
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,940
where should my pool be hmm I'm going to

56
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,149
make my pool on the right side of my

57
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,190
fountain because at least it will be in

58
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,330
front of my house that way rather than

59
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,730
like not over there it's kind of low

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:22,130
terabytes in the gate whoa nice skin

61
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:24,170
dude you are looking awesome alright so

62
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,900
what I'm going to do is we're gonna have

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,290
like the floating pool kind of dealio

64
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,320
going on here and it's gonna float off

65
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:39,830
of the edge I gotta take these flowers

66
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:45,250
back I'm gonna move some of them uh I'm

67
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,250
gonna start building my pool right here

68
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:54,650
I'm gonna do a little outline it's gonna

69
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,180
be a nice floating almost infinity pool

70
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,180
but I don't think that's possible in

71
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,320
Minecraft I think that's pretty wide

72
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:05,470
now let's I mean pretty uh deep not deep

73
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:11,660
I don't know what I'm saying right now

74
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:13,280
we'll make it a little bit longer this

75
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,100
is gonna be awesome

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,780
alright and then I'm gonna go back this

77
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:23,660
way we're have a nice little flower bed

78
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,850
on the side of the pool it's gonna be

79
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,599
pretty cool I should build a wooden deck

80
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:32,319
around it too I mean now we need a

81
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,019
shallow end wiser skills

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,180
kill that skeleton kill it

83
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,290
there's a battle going on right look at

84
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,750
that battle in their own backyard

85
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,810
it's like a TV show the closest you'll

86
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,180
get to a TV show in Minecraft yes and

87
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,760
terabrite wins all right

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,650
we're going to have a shot shallow end

89
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,470
and then we're going to get go to the

90
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,780
deep end so to do that I'm gonna go two

91
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,299
blocks down for actually one block down

92
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,609
for the shallow end and then the deep

93
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,400
end will be three blocks down so you're

94
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,349
making it out of court I was making a

95
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,349
cobblestone simple but I guess it looks

96
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,579
cool having a little outline so I don't

97
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:16,489
the thing is I don't have that much

98
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:18,229
courts left I have one block would you

99
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:23,509
mind handing me some courts that would

100
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:26,120
be cool because I'm in survival now all

101
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:28,070
right I got 59 thank you how are we

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,250
gonna do so the deep end is gonna be

103
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:36,800
three deep and then the very middle ah

104
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,400
is right there will be two deep not too

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:46,400
deep like as in it's too deep but you

106
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:47,930
know what I mean all right all right so

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,430
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in the rest

108
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:59,749
of this pool and I will be right back

109
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:59,749
[Music]

110
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:19,120
[Music]

111
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:22,330
are you mix tears alright so we've

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,340
finished building the pool this this is

113
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,460
the shallow end then it gets kind of

114
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,099
deeper and then that's the deep end and

115
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,379
we've got awesome stairs here now we

116
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:34,900
have an awesome floating pool but we

117
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,840
need to go get some water so let's go

118
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,719
find our buckets ah there we go

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,000
I knew I have at least one let's go on

120
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,280
down to the beach and grab ourselves a

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,069
bucket of water because a whole little

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,449
buckets gonna fill up an entire pool

123
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:55,090
right now makes total sense if only

124
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,520
things were that easy I need a proper

125
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,349
stairway down to the beach here we go

126
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
brights we're about to fill in the most

127
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:06,610
epic pool hope terabrite doesn't drown

128
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:15,550
oh wait I need more water

129
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:24,400
oops what the heck whoa oh cool that's a

130
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:27,940
good idea well maybe if I pour it from

131
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:34,330
the step it'll work I'm floating away

132
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:38,849
ah here we're gonna pour it on the step

133
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:42,069
oh no that's not what I wanted okay oh

134
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:48,240

swimming lessons why is there a circle

155
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,750
in the middle R square I mean I think

156
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:08,130
water needs to come out of the side but

157
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:12,270
I can't quite get it oh there we go

158
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,800
whoa and we have ourselves a pool it's

159
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,699
almost like a little jacuzzi because

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,620
it's like flowing like Jets so there you

161
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:22,289
have it folks

162
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:26,039
here is our awesome pool it's a nice

163
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:28,020
addition to our newly built mansion

164
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,110
let's move on to the next suggestion

165
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,120
Yolo whitey said that they have a lot of

166
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,490
experience making modern homes and

167
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,399
redstone and they said they make two to

168
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:43,140
five big rooms and use paintings and

169
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,880
frames so what we're gonna do that we

170
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,000
are going to do that I'm not quite sure

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,640
how to make paintings and frames because

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,020
I've actually never tried it and I kind

173
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,459
of want to figure it out in survival

174
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,880
mode so I'm gonna look it up so you

175
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,600
stick any wool in the center of sticks

176
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,240
that's it

177
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,730
all right that sounds easy we can do

178
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,310
that

179
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,590
do I have sticks I mean looks like I've

180
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:12,280
got some wood right here so I work with

181
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:16,120
that now we have a lot of sticks and I

182
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,160
need some mole let's see I might not

183
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,460
have any down here there we go we have

184
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,510
some and we're gonna add some color to

185
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,560
that wool so we're gonna use we're gonna

186
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,690
make it Orange

187
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,640
I'm not sure if this is how you do it um

188
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,700
orange dye there we go

189
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,430
and I don't know if this is gonna work

190
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,770
oh it does okay cool now we have orange

191
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,720
wool and we're gonna put sticks all

192
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:47,470
around it and now we have a painting yay

193
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:51,310
I did it so let's go upstairs to our

194
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,230
rooms we have my bedroom and I would

195
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:59,380
love to put two paintings right there so

196
00:09:53,230 --> 00:10:01,810
it could be um you know even symmetrical

197
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,820
so let's put our first painting that

198
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:06,040
what that's not a painting that is not

199
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,590
what I meant to do oh thank you for

200
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:12,760
getting rid of that and there there it

201
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:15,190
is there's a painting I need to make

202
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,430

203
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:23,110

295
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,310
to do so I'm gonna go add that to my

296
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,850
epic closet that'll eventually get more

297
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,590

301
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,720
it I've never crafted an armor stand but

302
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,970

307
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,490
make an armor stand

308
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,790
I made it correctly oh you got to put a

309
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,620

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,140
I need stone slab does it have to be

315
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:11,200
stone slab I don't think you can use any

316
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,020
slab I think you need stone stone slab

317
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:18,190
so we are going to make that cobblestone

318
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,870
wall I've never actually made that

319
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,600
that's weird

320
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:25,810
all right let's try this again I think I

321
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,790
hope I'm gonna do it correctly now so

322
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,730
here's how we make an armor stand

323
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:34,030
nope it didn't work it didn't work I

324
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:37,480
swear it's when Minecraft Wiki says this

325
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,589
is what it says and what am I doing

326
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,329
wrong

327
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:48,379
stick in stone slab it says this oh

328
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:49,779
that's that's a cobblestone slab oh you

329
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:57,319
would think you could use any slab

330
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:59,569
really ah we have 43 stone slabs yes who

331
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:03,139
knew I would have that that's amazing

332
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:06,380
let's try this again apparently it has

333
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:09,679
to be stone slab which makes no sense

334
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,110
but I will go with it and it worked man

335
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,120
I wish you could use other slabs alright

336
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,730
guys so you can only make an armor stand

337
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,459
with a stone slab that's a slab in the

338
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,939
face huh you're funny and here we have

339
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,589

340
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:27,400
armor stand that's awesome whoo are you

341
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:30,289
doing that's how it works

342
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,690

343
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:37,100

this is somewhat an old trend but I

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,389

Google myself and just have a look at

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,219

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,960
now showers him with designer gifts and

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,450
diamond jewelry to make him happy

72
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,580
this article is disease aside from

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,310
horrible journalism that basically

74
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,020
embodies the mail online you should see

75
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,400
how they moderate their comments the

76
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,070
lighting kept changing it was bothering

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,690
me there are only three comments yet

78
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,550
somehow fight at almost 600 up votes I

79
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,020
left them a few but you guessed it they

80
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,280
did not approve them I swear to god

81
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,070
they're only approving stuff that

82
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,990
literally agrees with the article don't

83
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,850
do it may if he's anything lot more

84
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,220
misses it'll end up bankrupting you

85
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,780
ready you're both young got a lot to

86
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,550
learn in terms of relationships to see

87
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,630
if what it is a bit of fun there's no

88
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,190
way this can be a serious long-term

89
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,810
relationship the thing is you guys don't

90
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,550
know the full story obviously I can't

91
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,880
blame you the commenters are not the

92
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,410
people to throw shade at it is the you

93
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,080
have to trace the rumor back to its

94
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,180
origin which would be in an editing room

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,580
shade it's interesting how a slightly

96
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,560
different perspective can change the

97
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,320
entire that is not quite what I was

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,060
looking for I guess to better illustrate

99
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,430
my point when you when you read the

100
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,620
article these are quotes I said but I

101
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,440
didn't say them in one sentence

102
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,320
these are stitched together from

103
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,390
different context you know even the mail

104
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,310
online changed it from the interview

105
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,290
which was changed you know it's like

106
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,180
Chinese whispers I don't point something

107
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,860
out while I'm here buying anything for

108
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,140

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,570
satisfying feeling wouldn't you agree it

110
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:48,080

178
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,050
know Mamie when did Jamie and Mike first

179
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,390
meet September seventh I believe what's

180
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,270
Jamie's favorite movie of all time I

181
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,980
don't know how do you know in the

182
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,080
two-year anniversary surprise video what

183
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,790
did Mike give Jamie that wasn't that as

184
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,590
the whisper challenge that's misleading

185
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,730
the picture that I'm being shown right

186
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,670

might meet Victoria Station XL London on

190
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:47,200
the under the underground train station

191
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,270
I guess that's specifically to throw off

192
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,400
anyone that's never been to London yet

193
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:53,230
you know that underground train station

194
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,480
the underground train station not know

195
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,890
any specific one just the underground

196
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,720

197
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,520
James's Gardens which YouTube star

198
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,770
follows Mike on twitter connor franta

199
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,080
obviously thanks to me Mike mentioned

200
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:10,950

201
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:12,570

technically say he lived in Sheffield

205
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,680
I guess that question was fundamentally

206
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,209
flawed Mike a lovely I come from the

Ever since the rise of violent media in TV, movies, and now video games, their effects on kids and society have been hotly debated. A number of studies have concluded that the effects of video games on individuals are generally negative. Generally people who play violent video games show an increase in aggression and a decrease in empathy. Though video game effects seem to be largely negative, a current study decided to further expand on the findings. Previous work done on the social effect of video games have been examined from a short term perspective. This new study examined video game effects in the long run and concluded there may be good effects of video games. 

2:44 New watch tells you if you're a boring conversationalist 

Scientists have finally developed a watch that can determine a conversations tone. Using audio, text transcriptions, and physiological signs this watch can determine a conversations tone with 83% accuracy. Researchers say this is most helpful for those with anxiety or aspergers because it acts like a social coach.

oh what's it's like to go viewers my

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,929
name is Donna and our first story comes

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,120
from the video gaming world remember

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,520
when we had some researchers saying that

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,470
violent video games creates violent kids

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,100
and then we had another group of

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,869
researchers saying no no no no and they

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,869
started to argue and there was this

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,240
whole clash well we've got some new

10
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,040
research on the situation but before we

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,230
jump right into the news I'd like to

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,360
thank our sponsor best feet

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,760
addicting

you'll get $5 worth of gold and diamonds

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,590
for free in the game of course back to

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,530
the news ever since the emergence of

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,900
violent TV shows movies and now video

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,180
games the topic of those things causing

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,340
aggression has been hotly debated the

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,200
majority of studies have found violent

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,570
video games linked to things like

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,450
increased aggression and decrease

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,670
empathy there's just one problem a

37
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,990
majority of those studies were focused

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,930
on short-term results

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,060
this means past studies typically had

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,299
someone to play a violent video game and

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,549
right after the game is done researchers

42
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,770
would test aggression and empathy level

43
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,229
what do you know aggression levels were

44
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,270
up at empathy levels were lower but

45
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,310
here's the thing those same results can

46
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,040
be found after any competitive or

47
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,409
frustrating task whether that be not

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,710
being able to solve a math problem or

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,170
not being able to pass level 40 of best

50
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,509
feat because of this researchers in

51
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,030
Germany decided to test for long-term

52
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:09,700
effects

53
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,670
instead of requiring participants to

54
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,580
play games like in past studies

55
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,080
scientists recruited people who already

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,150
regularly play violent video games and

57
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,730
people who don't play violent video

58
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,830
games gamers and non-gamers were then

59
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,230
shown a series of images that would

60
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,810
evoke some sort of emotional response

61
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,540
for example according to past studies

62
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,790
this image would not move a gamer as

63
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,069
much as a non gamer once shown the

64
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,739
images neural responses were examined

65
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,810
via SMR I results show both groups

66
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:43,570
having the same level of empathy

67
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,400
contrary to previous studies our last

68
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,650
story comes from the Massachusetts

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Institute of Technology where scientists

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,140
have developed an AI system that can

71
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,050
detect a conversations tone so how this

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,040
works is that users wear this watch like

73
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,810
device the device analyzes audio text

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,569
transcriptions and physiological signs

75
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,519
for example more sad and negative

76
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,370
conversations are usually associated

77
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:12,310
with more pauses Naughton is local tones

78
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,739
and increased cardiovascular activity

79
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,200
the device takes record of this and is

80
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:19,200
able to classify the emotional tone of a

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,820
conversation with eighty-three percent

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,950
accuracy now the researchers of the

83
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,690
system claim it's most useful for those

84
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,329
who need some sort of social coach

85
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,150
people with Asperger's or anxiety but

86
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,640
imagine how conversations would be if

87
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,110
everyone had a watch like this that's

88
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,190
all the news we have for you today I

89
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,079
hope you enjoyed it

90
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,060
we had sex ago would like to know your

91
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,250
opinion and what you learned today

92
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,200
you think violent video games causes

93
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,510
increased aggression what do you think

94
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,870
about this mood but I'll see you guys

95
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,870

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,310
the next few years out of the reflection

83
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,020
of your forehead okay I didn't expect

84
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,850
you guys to be so good at this what's

85
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,070
more disturbing that thing you call a

86
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,680
smile or that your forehead is shinier

87
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,630
than your shoe like a frigid zebra out

88
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,100
this bitch what your hairline is

89
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,130
receding faster than your chances of

90
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,320
getting a man I am the strapping of

91
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,580
hairline let's talk about the last

92
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,709

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:17,460

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,440
playing this game and it has become my

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,809
new go to travel obsession when I need a

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,940
little break from knitting best fiends

18
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,789
is a free puzzle adventure game where

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,309
you collect and build a team of fiend to

20
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,920
defeat slugs by matching pink colored

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:05,369
objects hmm I wonder do you think to say

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,630
allowing us to pack actual slugs so you

23
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,180
know when I need a break for my knitting

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,150
this game is perfect for long travel

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,960
because time totally flies by as I try

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,060
to level out today I am on level 41 so

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,850
try to beat me and tell me what level

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,040
you are on this month you can play it

29
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,950
the Easter egg challenge where you win

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,979
amazing and rare rewards if you beat all

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,369
16 challenges you'll win an all new

32
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,710
funny character so download this game

33
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,150
for free I have a link down in the

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,650
description below and if you download

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,409
now you will get $5 worth of gold and

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,250
diamonds for free I'm pretty sure that's

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,700
virtual gold and diamonds so it was a

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,049
cute little yarn cutting pendant but

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,840
confiscated I suppose they do not

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,950
appreciate weapon rides jewelry I feel

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,899
like this is three in a row with it

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,149
being able to cut yarn with this little

43
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,180
pendant on my necklace I learned my

44
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,180
lesson

45
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:08,490
now one of these rules are hard and fast

46
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,730
and they often change especially with a

47
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,800
TSA agents disposition that day so let's

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,900
look at the ways to maximize the

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
opportunity that we will be able to

50
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,800
carry these knitting tools on to our

51
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,510
plane now luckily knitting needles are

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,310
totally fine

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,819
the preferred knitting needles are

54
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,950
plastic or wood over metal and even

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,190
better our circular needles now there's

56
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,640
no length limit however when it comes to

57
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:39,959
tools TSA seems to prefer any tool under

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,090
7 inches and if you can knit with really

59
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,819
short needles that's great you know

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,010
circular needles are perfect as well

61
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,950
they really seem to treat those less

62
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,110
like daggers if a vampire have a female

63
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,630
plane and you're 10 net with circular

64
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,569
needles exactly as you do with just 8

65
00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:00,000
needles so that is a really good bet

66
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,519
especially with these really cute bamboo

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,019
circular needles I'll have links down in

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,660
the description below to everything I'm

69
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,120
sharing with you now scissors yes you

70
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,329
actually can carry scissors if you want

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,660
to be super safe you could bring nail

72
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:18,690
clippers but you also could bring these

73
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,470
cute little deserve a prefer scissors to

74
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:25,500
be 4 inches in length or less and to be

75
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,350
very considerate to your TSA agent it is

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,940
preferred to wrap the pointy edges of

77
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,430
any tools that you're bringing so that

78
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,180
they don't accidentally pop themselves

79
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,970
oh no yarn okay you're are you can bring

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,260
any kind of yarn you want basically

81
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,299
weight restrictions are really the only

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,390
thing that holds me back from packing as

83
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,880
much yarn as I possibly can and I always

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,859
like to put it in plastic and then into

85
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,900
a little travel bag your attendance is

86
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,989
being handled I really don't like the

87
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,060
idea of other people touching my yarn a

88
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,880
little tapestry needles as well are

89
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,480
totally fine just make sure that they're

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,989
packed in something that will not poke

91
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,630
them at all again tsa rules can often

92
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,770
change now if you want to be super

93
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,100
prepared

94
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,920
do not pack anything that has great

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,050
sentimental value or is super expensive

96
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,720
you could also bring a self-addressed

97
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:23,850
stamped envelope and I like a padded

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,590
envelope and then if anything like

99
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,660
leather appended those get confiscated

100
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,330
you can slip it into that mail it back

101
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,670
home so whether it is a quick little

102
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,830
island hop or a long international

103
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,690
flight I hope you feel a little bit more

104
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,490
prepared to board your flight with

105
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,660
appropriate knitting tools that are

106
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,890
totally allowed on your plane and if you

107
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,840
are playing bussines

108
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,100
let me know down in the comments below I

109
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,900
am obsessed it is a really great break

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,700
from your knitting so go check it out

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,490

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,519
totally different kind of game this is

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,890
an addictive clicker adventure game

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,960
where you slap collect and level up

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,449
pretty much everything in the game while

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,349
trying to get as far as you can as fast

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,600
as you can

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,520
now during the game you get all sorts of

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,500
power-ups and special moves that you can

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,200
use to either help you get even more

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,059
coins or the power you pass some of the

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,430
really hard bosses at the end of the

20
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,110
levels it's a great way to pass the time

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,550
when you have a few minutes to spare

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,190
here and there and there are also

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,030
rewards for letting your fiends collect

24
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,399
coins for you

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,170
while you take a break from the game but

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,690
if you want to advance past the levels

27
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,020
you have to actually be playing the game

28
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,239
now some of my favorite things in the

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,150
game or when you level up your original

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,909
fiends and when they hit level 100 they

31
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,070
get a 1000 time modifier to their damage

32
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,860
the other thing I like is upgrading

33
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,689
their special moves but anyway guys you

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,030
should really check this new game out I

35
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,549
mean it's free and you can download it

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,560
from the link down below so let me know

37
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,270
how far you get in the game and let me

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,509
know which fiends special move is your

39
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,509
favorite me personally mine is the Otto

40
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,869
hey YouTube friends my name is Prince

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,430
and I'm an urban acolyte and in this

42
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,200
video I want to address the growing

43
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,840
opinion that Star Wars rebels is

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,579
becoming even more gray this season and

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,590
I want to take up the question of

46
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,740
whether or not Ezra Bridger will

47
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,930
eventually become a great Jedi first

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,659
let's look at why people feel that this

49
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,670
season is becoming even more great so in

50
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,680
season 1 we were first introduced to

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,079
Kanan Ezra and the rest of the ghost

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,289
crew we learned that not only were there

53
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,879
other Jedi who survived order 66 but

54
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,740
there were also children of the force

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,170
being hunted down by the Empire's

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,260
quiz' ters to either join the Empire or

57
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,090
be eliminated we later learned that the

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,550
ghost crew and other rebel cells were

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,830
all receiving Intel from fulcrum agents

60
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,910
with the first fulcrum agent having been

61
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:32,190
ahsoka tano we moved into season two and

62
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,590
things became a bit more difficult for

63
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,390
the rebels after Kanan managed to defeat

64
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,820
the Grand Inquisitor above Mustafar

65
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,370
Darth Vader personally dealt the rebels

66
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,320
a serious blow and two new inquisitors

67
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,680
appeared to hunt down both Ezra and

68
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,990
Kanan by the end of season two there

69
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,210
were a number of questions ahsoka tano

70
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,820
appeared to face her end at the hands of

71
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,370
Darth Vader on maligore Kanan was

72
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,530
blinded by maw his Maul attempted to

73
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,680
claim Ezra as his own apprentice and

74
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,230
Ezra was last seen opening an ancient

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,320
Sith holocron from that temple at mallik

76
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,610
court now on the plus side it appeared

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,460
that we'd seen the last of the

78
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,410
inquisitors and Phoenix squadron secured

79
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,290
their base on Eidolon to grow their

80
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,540
fleet of ships now when we pick up with

81
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,060
season 3 about six months have passed

82
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,680
since the events of Malick or Kanan

83
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,870
attempted to shut himself off from the

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,630
forces he used his blindness as a crutch

85
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,240
and that drove a wedge between Kanan and

86
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,870
everyone else I mean it drove a wedge

87
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,640
between master and apprentice

88
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,670
Ezra had grown older both physically and

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,800
in the force because Kanan was not

90
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,990
around to give Ezra guidance well as

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,700
return to that Sith holocron and he

92
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,870
learned new powers and abilities that

93
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,550
some may consider unnatural it's not

94
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,970
really the kinds of things that a Jedi

95
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,440
would do in certain situations now even

96
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,480
though there are questions regarding

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,520
whether or not both the holocron form a

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,680
liqueur and Kanaan's holocron were

99
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,560
destroyed when Maul forced as word

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,690
emerged the two together what we know is

101
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,180
that Ezra has learned things from that

102
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,210
holocron he's learned all about the dark

103
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,460
side and the Sith and if the holocron

104
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,920
has not been destroyed then there's the

105
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,710
potential for Ezra to learn more from it

106
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,950
and remember what the bindu said once a

107
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,030
secret is learned it can't be unlearned

108
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,919
now we also have to take into

109
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,750
consideration the statements made from

110
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,590
sanh wit

111
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:33,350
who voices mall in that mall sees Ezra

112
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,810
as his apprentice and although mall is

113
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,670
no longer a synth he's interested in

114
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,380
turning Ezreal and this presents

115
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,440
something interesting because we don't

116
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,810
really know what mall is mall was

117
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,940
trained as a Sith and he was to be the

118
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,360
apprentice to dart city as prior to his

119
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,640
well shall we say it accident on Naboo

120
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,460
along with city is becoming aware with

121
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,440
the chosen one Anakin Skywalker not long

122
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,320
after the apparent demise of Maul and

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,360
Maul was also the son of mother Towson

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,920
he was the son of not only the clan

125
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,210
mother of the knight sisters and

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,940
brothers on Dathomir

127
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,270
but mother Towson was arguably the most

128
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,220
powerful shaman on Dathomir unlike the

129
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,840
other night brothers Maul was taught to

130
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,120
channel the forest through his Sith

131
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,370
training and we now have reason to

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,650
believe that will Maul has become a

133
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,630
shaman in his tradition something that

134
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,450
was previously barred - the males on

135
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,780
Dathomir only women receive the honor of

136
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,310
becoming a shaman in their tradition so

137
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,980
i mentioned all of this because this is

138
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,440
Maz background it's his heritage once he

139
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,600
was a Sith now a possible shaman and

140
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,090
sole survivor of the shaman from

141
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,450
Dathomir it could this be what Maul

142
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,760
wants to pass on Israa and as for Ezra

143
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,370
he has the possibility of receiving Jedi

144
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,500
training Sith training and possibly an

145
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,630
introduction into the shaman practices

146
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,060
from Dathomir when we see the green

147
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,460
mists in a coming episode this season in

148
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,030
Star Wars rebels now something to

149
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,520
consider

150
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,950
the only other Jedi exposed to the green

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,360
mist was Quinlan vos and he made a brief

152
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,000
turn to the dark side

153
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,860
after Ventress took him to Dathomir now

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,650
of course Count Dooku was responsible

155
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,530
for Voss's turn but the green mist does

156
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,910
have connections to the darkside

157
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,680
specifically to the son of mortis and

158
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,750
I'll talk about this more in my night

159
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,460
sister magic video that it's going to

160
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,979
come out around the time we see the

161
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,840
green mist on Star Wars rebels but my

162
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,270
point is that I think this could nudge

163
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,000
Ezra back towards the dark side and

164
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,550
recall that we saw an entity in the mist

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,190
in a clip we saw a shot of Kanan

166
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,510
attacking Sabine and Ezra and we saw

167
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,160
Kanan dueling with Maul

168
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,050
there's a rumor floating around that

169
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,870
asthma and Maul will eventually duel

170
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,270
each other and I have to wonder if Ezra

171
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,740
and Moll actually have a confrontation

172
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,110
could this event be the catalyst for

173
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,310
what makes them become real adversaries

174
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,170
I mean maybe

175
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,330
Ezra starts to see things from Mom's

176
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,520
perspective for a short time before

177
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,500
reaching some conclusion that well

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,050
Marla's bad for the galaxy and he needs

179
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,760
to be taken out and now I'm putting all

180
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,500
of this forward because there's this

181
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,130
question about Ezra becoming a great

182
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,260
Jedi

183
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,930
I mean Ezra is getting exposed to all

184
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:17,070
this stuff SIF knowledge the green mist

185
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,940
well will he become a great Jedi so

186
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,580
here's the thing

187
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,370
the term gray Jedi technically doesn't

188
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,800
exist in Canon when Pablo Hidalgo was

189
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,200
asked on Twitter back in June about gray

190
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,990
Jedi he feigned ignorance of the turn

191
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,600
and when we look at this term gray Jedi

192
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,430
in the extended universe or in legends

193
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,520
we really don't have a clear definition

194
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:41,130
of what it is to be a gray Jedi we only

195
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,740
know what a great Jedi isn't so someone

196
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,930
like Quinlin boss boss was exposed to

197
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,820
the green mist I said it earlier fell in

198
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,860
love with Ventress and fell to the dark

199
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,380
side when Duke who tortured him until he

200
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,870
turned later Duke who killed Ventress

201
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,970
and her death caused Voss to completely

202
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,730
renounce the dark side and turned back

203
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,560
to the light now I'm using vos as an

204
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,990
example because we know that a Jedi in

205
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,780
turns to the dark side and returns to

206
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,600
the light is technically not a gray Jedi

207
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,180
in many uses of the term a gray Jedi is

208
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,730
a force user who uses both dark and

209
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,850
light sides of the force but never

210
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:19,530
becomes corrupted by the dark side now

211
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,930
the problem is when we have people like

212
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,210
qui-gon jinn I mean qui-gon was

213
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,250
considered gray but that was only

214
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,350
because he had no problem going against

215
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,180
the orders of the Jedi Council and this

216
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,700
was mostly due to philosophical

217
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,430
differences qui-gon was deeply committed

218
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,900
to understanding the Living force and we

219
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,180
learned that his philosophical

220
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,820
differences led him to being contacted

221
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,740
by the forest priestesses or the wills

222
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,160
who taught him to preserve one's

223
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,470
consciousness beyond death so without

224
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,240
qui-gon jinn obi-wan and Yoda would not

225
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,260
have been able to become forest ghosts

226
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,810
and I guess Anakin to since when

227
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,540
throw him in there but anyway what is a

228
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,240
great Jedi groups like the Jin sorry

229
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,090
the Voss and Jedi like jolie bindle and

230
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,980
qui-gon jinn are not the same so this

231
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:08,410
term braid Jedi has basically become a

232
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,160
bit of a blanket term for anyone who

233
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,990
isn't a Jedi a Dark Jedi or a Sith so at

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,510
this point we've got an interesting

235
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,640
situation I mean we have two Jedi Ezra

236
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,680
and Kanan and we're about two or three

237
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,050
years before the events in a new hope

238
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,000
and when Yoda speaks with Luke before

239
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,880
his death in Return of the Jedi

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,180
he tells Luke that well they are the

241
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,190
last of the Jedi and if Ezra and Kanan

242
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,690
both managed to survive the events

243
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,120
leading up to the destruction of the

244
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,210
first Death Star and they lived through

245
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,790
this galactic civil war well then where

246
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,740
are they and what are they doing could

247
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,170
they become the first official grey Jedi

248
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,420
and Canon does Ezra fall to the dark

249
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,580
side or does he become something else

250
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,070
after being exposed to the green mist

251
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,980
the bindu and the knowledge that he's

252
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,660
learned from his systolic Rahn but what

253
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,760
do you all think what are your

254
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,010
predictions for Ezra's fate in Star Wars

255
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,510
rebels and do you think that he'll live

256
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,910
through the official rebellion in

257
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,650
episodes four through six I mean there's

258
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,960
some people out there who think Ezra

259
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,830
will either live on to father Rey or

260
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,840
start the Knights of Ren but anyway let

261
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,640
me know your thoughts down below I'm

262
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,410
going to keep notes of your ideas and

263
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,050
your predictions so we can continue to

264
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,690
speculate as the story progresses on

265
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:27,340

00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:04,185
- Alright you guys, I think we've

2
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:06,022
got addicted to a new game.

3
00:00:06,022 --> 00:00:08,144
It's called Best Fiends.

4
00:00:08,144 --> 00:00:09,122
It's a lot,

5
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:11,160
it's very similar to Candy Crush but

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,462
there's over 400 levels and you

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:17,216
you go as different heroes
and you're trying to

8
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,536
defeat these slugs.

9
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:19,941
And each level has it's own goals.

10
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,591
Right, so it's not like
Candy Crush where like,

11
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:23,609
just break as many 
candies as you can.

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:25,507
It actually gives 
you a goal like kill,

13
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:28,102
you know defeat 
x amount of slugs

14
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:31,888
and collect so many leaves
or so many water droplets.

15
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,315
And there's all these characters,

16
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,058
and each character has 
their own power ups

17
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:38,336
and things that like make
your hero stronger and

18
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:40,669
oh man it's super addicting.

19
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:49,310
A new summer update 
is out for the game

20
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,838

You diggin' it, Sierra?

33
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,884
- Mhmmm.

34
00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:12,120
- What level we on?

35
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,287
I think we're on level 34.

36
00:01:15,584 --> 00:01:16,808
And like I said there's over 400.

37
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,438
So weeks of fun guys.

38
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:20,318
We'll be playing this 
all summer long.

39
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:21,588

00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:22,486
what level are you on?

41
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:23,631
What's your favorite character,

42
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,097
favorite heroes in the game?

43
00:01:25,097 --> 00:01:26,821
Tweet me @clintus, I wanna know.

44
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,831
(light music)

45
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,426
- So we are on the drive to

46
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,385
the seal beach

47
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,939
where we can see 
sea lions on the beach.

48
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,219
So we're on the drive
and playing a game called

49
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,904
20 questions.
- [Bryce] Yeah.

50
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:45,372
- It's where someone 
thinks of something

51
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,611
like an animal.

52
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:48,615
And then we have to ask
20 questions about it

53
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:50,439
and try to get the animal.

54
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,251
I'll go, I'll go.

55
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,796
- Don't think of 
extremely hard animals.

56
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:55,629
Sierra already said it.

57
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,563
- Um, I'm thinking of, okay.
I got it.

58
00:01:57,563 --> 00:01:58,816
- [Man] Ya got it?
- Yep.

59
00:01:59,522 --> 00:02:02,315
- [Mason] Does it live 
in the jungle?

60
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:03,218
- No.

61
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:05,484
- [Bryce] Does it live 
in the desert?

62
00:02:05,484 --> 00:02:06,317
- No.

63
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:09,783
- [Max] Does it have four legs?

64
00:02:09,783 --> 00:02:11,465
- Yes.

65
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,107
- Alright I said, it was a turtle.

66
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:13,940
Mason got it.

67
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,690
Now Mason's gonna go.

68
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,227
- [Sierra] Right there.

69
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:31,501
They're right there.

70
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:34,984
They're just on the 
beach layin' down.

71
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:41,160
There's some big ones, and
there's some tiny ones.

72
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,313
Oh look at that guy.

73
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,216
It's so funny when 
you watch them walk.

74
00:02:59,216 --> 00:03:01,719
Earlier there was one, 
he just started

75
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,552
the wave came 
and he just started.

76
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:07,032
Oh he's mad.

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,520
They're making music.

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,770
Er er er er ow.

79
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,241
Er er er er ow.

80
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,259
They're outta here.

81
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,491
They just started running.

82
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,383
The big guy was 
walking all slow.

83
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:23,655

85

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,063
Whoa.

99
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:06,243
He sneezed.

100
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,839
He just sneezed on Uncle Ken.

101
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,553
Look out the big guy's comin.

102
00:04:15,553 --> 00:04:19,531
That was the 
big guy, he just left.

103
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:23,269
That girl was right there
and he almost ran her over.

104
00:04:29,457 --> 00:04:30,290
Hey dude.

105
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,588
Look at the little crab just
hangin out in the water here.

106
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,662
It's a squirrel.

107
00:04:54,483 --> 00:04:55,436
Squirrel.

108
00:04:56,887 --> 00:05:00,143
There are baby squirrels
and they're so cute.

109
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,442
Little baby squirrels.

110
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,250
It's a little baby squirrel.

111
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,348
So tiny I don't know if you
guys can see it from here

112
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,156
but he is so tiny.

113
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:10,425
Look at him look at him.

114
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:12,012
- Yet another bike ride.

115
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,411
What are we doin', Sierra?

116
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,244
- Bike riding.

117
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:16,799
- Another bike ride, 
oh my goodness.

118
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,774
It's what we do in San Diego
because the weather's amazing

119
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:21,487
and there's just so 
much to see on a bike.

120
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,469
Right?
- Mhmmm.

121
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:23,412
- [Clintus] Right.

122
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:25,455
Right.

123
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,631
We found our old beach house.

124
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,609
This is from three years ago.

125
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:38,021
Same concept, two houses combined.

126
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,912
Patio is much bigger though.

127
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:41,727
I like this one a lot better.

128
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,899
- So Sierra, what are we doin'?

129
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:45,959
- Lookin at stores.

130
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,420
- She has 20 dollars
to spend on a souvenir

131
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,488
so ya gonna 
look for somethin'?

132
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,437
Like a hat?

133
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,502
I was thinkin maybe a hat.

134
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:52,659
Right?

135
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,326
Alright, let's go in.

136
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:05,010
Wanna try that one on?

137
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:52,313
- [Clintus] Ice cream time, dude?

138
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:53,590
What ya getting?

139
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,771
Cookies and creme, the classic.

140
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,171
Bryce's favorite.

141
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,352
And chocolate ra ra.

142
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,874
I want chocolate.

143
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:02,725
Cookies and creme.

144
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:03,725
Order it up.

145
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:20,141
Which cone do you want?

146
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:28,369
If that's what you want.

147
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:32,786
I found a wild Sierra 
with a new hat.

148
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,694
Look at that hat.

149
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,010
Did mommy already vlog that?

150
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,958
Alright lemme look.

151
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,791
Lemme see.

152
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,624
Lemme see.

153
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,457
Turn it around.

154
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,453
No you just turn it around.

155
00:07:39,453 --> 00:07:41,180
Says Cali, it's blue, 
it's her colors.

156
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,702
That's like her color.

157
00:07:42,702 --> 00:07:43,535
It's very cute.

158
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,553
Snap back.

159
00:07:44,553 --> 00:07:47,146
Totally, totally Sierra's style.

160
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,339
I love it.

161
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,862
And of course we had to
get her some ice cream.

162
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,306
Mint chocolate chip 
in a waffle cone.

163
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,501
Bryce go this cookies and creme.

164
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:53,609
That's like your favorite flavors.

165
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:54,720
You guys stick to 
your favorite flavors.

166
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,470
I like it, I like it.

167
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,470
(waves crashing
and children screaming)

168
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,005
- Gnarly bro.

169
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,977

170
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:52,810
Ha ha.

171
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:04,873
Well this is it guys.

172
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:06,809
Last night in San Diego.

173
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:08,047
What are you guys's thoughts?

174
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,363

175
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,196

176
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,029
- Yeah?

177
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,638
- What was your 
favorite part of this trip?

178
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,517
- The beach, went to the zoo.

179
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:18,204
- The beach, the zoo.

180
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,037

181
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,299

182
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,456
- Belmont.

183
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,523

184
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:23,356

What was your favorite part?

186
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,335
- No you can't have,
that's her favorite part.

187
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:26,426
You can't have the same one.

188
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:27,259
I'm just kidding.

189
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,172
- The zoo.
- I'm just kidding.

190
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,495
No, the beach.
The beach is awesome.

191
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:30,988
And the best part
is like it's free right.

192
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,167
It's like free, it's just always
here for everybody to use.

193
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,618
Pretty cool, right?

194
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:35,853

199
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:41,941

my favorite part

204
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,765
just having 
everybody get together.

205
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,449
Both sides of the family.

206
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:51,888
Tiffany's entire family was here.

207
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:54,280
And most of my family was here.

208
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,633
We're missing one brother

209
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,684

210
00:09:56,684 --> 00:09:57,388

212
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,182

place such as San Diego.

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,500
sandwich we're first going to start out

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,300
by creaming our butter just like this

30
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,739
then we're going to add sugar while the

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,870
butter is creamy and we're going to mix

32
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,489
it around and let it stir stir stir the

33
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,740
next thing I'm going to do is add an egg

34
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,990
mmm I love eggs and another egg I'm not

35
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,670
going to add some vanilla extract

36
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,770
directly into our bowl and mix it up

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,630
just like that now it's time to sift our

38
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,159
flour and other dry ingredients together

39
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,590
I'm going to start pouring our flour

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
directly into the stick just like this

41
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,549
and once you do that you just want to

42
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,420
just pour it in and just give it a lot

43
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,340
of tops like this oh my gosh now I'm

44
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,650
adding in some cocoa powder that's how

45
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,210
this is going to be chocolaty oh don't

46
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,530
forget the extra cocoa powder right

47
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,979
there now we're going to shake that all

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,229
in there to grab your wish and give this

49
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,180
a great stir stir stir and mix it all

50
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,770
together and make it all beautiful once

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,299
your mixture is all mixed together you

52
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,270

53
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,549
concoction over here oh my goodness is

sides off and get ready to put it

59
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,929
directly in

60
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,179
a pan that looks just like this and I'm

61
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:12,260

62
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,989

yourself in a very gay and relatable way

110
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,159

to live and eat and sleep and even

115
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,040
breathe oh my god and there you have it

116
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,010

your very own gay video now go out there

118
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,050

120
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,540

130
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,180
like I have to scream I'm gay from the

131
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,340
rooftops every day to be a excessively

trying to say everyone is more than

135
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,690
their sexuality and one sexuality should

136
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,610
not be the defining point on what they

137
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,720
give in this world or how they function

138
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,220
in life and it shouldn't be your

139
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,440
defining point on that person's

140
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,300

internet back in the day and you know

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,300

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,149
making YouTube videos and just been

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,520

told you guys these things before I

64
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,830
think No so reverse on up the very first

65
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,650
thing is that when I was in college one

66
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,750
time I was outed in a group chat with

67
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,280
all my high school friends and this is

68
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,470
how that happened I was out one night

69
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,030
and I'm feeling quite courageous and so

70
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,560
I was like I'm going to get my friend

71
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,450
and I'm going to tell her that I'm gay

72
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,790
I'm just gonna like let's do it bite the

73
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,459
bullet I said to this test and I kind of

74
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,810
like worded it silly ish but like that's

75
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,820
my personality and I'm just trying to

76
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,220
let make it light-hearted and then like

77
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,350
two minutes later that's saying curse

78
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,880
and text in a group chat was like all my

79
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,770
high school friends and I'm like uh

80
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,930
career didn't respond to my variance

81
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,850
like big text but she just texted as a

82
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,489
group chatting wonder what she said she

83
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,100
is screenshot is the text that I sent

84
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,959
her and posted it in the group chat and

85
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,750
said lol guys

86
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,100
someone stole Shannon phone and is

87
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:25,070
pretending like Shannon's gay I give you

88
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,590
guys the true story I was mortified and

89
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,570
at the time I was out to fifty percent

90
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,459
of the people in that group chat cuz I

91
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,739
had to do like it's crazy damage control

92
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,900
and text in the group shot and basically

93
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,890
would then out into all my high school

94
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:43,910
friends no it was really being really

95
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,160
good anyway moral the story not all

96
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,620
coming out experiences go according to

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,250
plan but I'm so breathing all as well

98
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,049
okay thing number two my voice sounds

99
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,940
really different and someone like

100
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,890
earlier YouTube videos like click

101
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,120
doesn't sound like me now at all you

102
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,890
could go watch them if you want they're

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,390
a little cringy but do what you want and

104
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,970
the reason that it's like that is

105
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,700
because I filmed a lot of my first ever

106
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,049
YouTube videos in my sorority house if

107
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,870
you did not have an authority now you

108
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,580
know and I was so paranoid that someone

109
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,069
was going to hear me like talking and

110
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,139
like do

111
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,329
YouTube videos and I was an out like

112
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,120
general anxiety about me being outed

113
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,910
living in the third house so I'm talking

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
like SuperDuper quiet and awkward and

115
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,449
weird because I'm in a sorority house

116
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,190
where I live with a hundred other girls

117
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:30,240
who did not know yet and I just think

118
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,789
that's kind of interesting

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,130
okay here comes the juicy one I was in

120
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:37,500
love with a boy and he broke my heart

121
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,289
who would have thought this little game

122
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,479
would have both words come out for now

123
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,520
basically I gave this kid in sixth grade

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,770
who is now like one of my best friends

125
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,870
we'll entire world and we dated on and

126
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,120
off like from middle school in high

127
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,250
school and like I thought that I was

128
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,590
head over heels in love with this kid

129
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,870
because he also never with like

130
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,340
lightened bath like such a challenge

131
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,780
would date me for like five minutes and

132
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,070
then who's like break up again and he

133
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,580
was date someone else and I was like oh

134
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,900
why don't you love me then I kissed a

135
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,599
girl for the first time and I was like

136
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,750
this is what love is meant to feuless

137
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:15,449
yeah no I I didn't I didn't really

138
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,130
that's not what I was wrong okay this

139
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,530
one's embarrassing but I also think that

140
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,150
this is like a very common thing I'm

141
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,340
convinced that other people do this I

142
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,530
was her like a two-week period where I

143
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,320
convinced myself that I could sing i

144
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,580
total why I thought I could I think I

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,979
was like driving around my car

146
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,539
sing-alongs like some ed Sheeran or

147
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,090
something and I was like I think I like

148
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:39,150
actually have like vocal capability

149
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,610
capability I finally one day decided to

150
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,190
put it to a test so I opened up the

151
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,440
voice memo on my phone and I recorded

152
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,990
myself doing this lovely duet with Ed

153
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,949
Sheeran moral distorted I cannot fucking

154
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,860
sing at all not at all

155
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:57,690
it gave us quite a shock who the

156
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,280
Heartbreakers we heard see me oh my gosh

157
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,979

very distinctive courses we start up

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,960
number one with the alcoholic appetizer

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,210

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,399
officially the candy corn season tonight

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,000
we will be in dedicating this whole

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,420
entire meal to these ridiculously little

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,430
kid disgusting sugar triangles I had a

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,780
ton of you actually have been suggesting

18
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,670
it candy corn

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,430
shot glasses which is what we're gonna

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,010
get started on right now I actually took

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,180
it one step further and went above and

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,420
beyond

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,000
earlier today I grabbed some vodka and

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,470
infused it with some candy corns and

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,330
this is what this is what we're looking

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,820
at everything is kind of like weirdly

27
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,420
separated into this candy corn spectrum

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,760
boom

29
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,530
candy corn vodka we got to make the shot

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,420
glasses first to start you got to get

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,820
yourself one of these fancy little molds

32
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,439
and I need to pick up these candy melts

33
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,299
and it's simple enough you just melt

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,670
these down and you put them in the shot

35
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,340
glasses one layer at a time starting

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:32,670
with the yellow follow it up with the

37
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,790
orange top it off with the whites and

38
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,270
then you gotta put these over here in

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,280
the fridge boom you gotta let that sit

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,930
in there for about 30 minutes which

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,909
means you've got some you've got some

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,420
time on your hands and what better way

43
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:55,310
to kill some time wait for it wait for

44
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:58,310
it then to play some best beans damn

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,310

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,170
is that they are not made out of candy

91
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,239
corn bullsh

92
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,810

round two

102
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,750
by the way there's no leakage in any of

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:26,139

105
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,340

along to our to our entree this is

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,650
inspired by this asshole on Twitter food

111
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,449
thought it was a good idea to just take

112
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,330
candy corns and put them on top of a

113
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,849
pizza let pop this in the oven over here

114
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,800
and then probably like cook it for about

115
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:56,289
half of its cycle and then bring it back

116
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,449
out and put these little candy corns on

117
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:01,479
but in the meantime I'm gonna I'm gonna

118
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,740
try to create an actual edible candy

119
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,930
corn pizza

120
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,180

121
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,710
one of these cheese pizzas and I'm just

122
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,380
I'm taking some different colored

123
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,270

124
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380

terrible all right so we got our pizza

146
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,400

147
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,220
this color combo here the yellow orange

148
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,300
and white yeah oh and then with the

149
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:32,400
mozzarella in the middle oh shit this is

150
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,800
the candy corn pizza that the internet

151
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,630
should be going crazy over can you see

152
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,790
it can you see it right there like when

153
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,510
you come into a little triangle boom

154
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,840
candy corn pizza oh right it is time to

155
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:48,120
throw it back into the oven for just a

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,320
couple more minutes taking that one out

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,840
and put in this one look at that just

158
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,970
melted into the crust right there it's

159
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,080
almost formed like almost like a

160
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,630
gelatinous plastic layer of sugar and

161
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,050
cheese on top which ah maybe delicious I

162
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:11,580
don't know let's dig in let's go for it

163
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:17,190
ha wait a minute wait a minute wait a

164
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:27,930
minute Oh delicious

165
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:29,070
Wow know that I hate candy corns but at

166
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,750
this point it doesn't even taste like

167
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,940
candy corns because the candy corns kind

168
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,380
of blend with the cheese and a kind it's

169
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:46,860
like a cheesy sugary delight Oh

170
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:49,200
big fan big fan over here burning down

171
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,110
the house okay cut that up into

172
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,510
triangles with the yellow and the orange

173
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,950
and the white it kind of works it's not

174
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,920
that great but it's the thought that

175
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,550
counts right to be honest with you this

176
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:06,000
isn't as good as the candy corn pizza

177
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,830
Wow I don't know if I can ever go back

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,740

I married your daughter and I'm not even

one thing that you know you always get

from us is honesty and I'm going to be

76
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,620
honest with you right now we're probably

77
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,770
richer than you but what you shouldn't

78
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,140
be upset about is the fact that we used

79
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,470
a sob story yeah to get your attention

80
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,060

99
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,810

it's like an expensive habit but this is

104
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:47,080

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,140
no okay well yeah but we like them we

130
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,880
relatable like that in it like really

131
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,560
normal family like because we're like

132
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,640
married and we're going to kids but like

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,500
we're just so much richer and better

134
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,330
such as people want to watch but they're

135
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,310

One of our most-requested videos this past year has been a ""What's On My iPhone"" video! We are super appreciative to Best Fiends for partnering with us on this special phone tour video for you! 

In today's video, you'll get a deeper look into my personality by seeing what apps I keep on my phone, including those that I use the most! I am super picky in how I organize my apps in folders, and love that everything is usually only 1 click away from the home screen.

We do spend a lot of time on our YouTube and social media apps, as well as our CuteGirlsHairstyles app. I also love my scriptures app and my Kindle app. I only have one game on my phone... can you guess what it is??? Best Fiends!

Be sure to subscribe, because Bailey will be doing a ""What's on my iPhone"" video sometime in the near future!

💥SUPERFANS💥: Please help us translate this What's on Brooklyn's iPhone video, and get credit below! http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=k1AuzB7kNAY

phone I kind of have it like all

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,460
organized and it's very simple it's all

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,560
in one page cuz I don't like like

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,180

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,309

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,120

Weather Channel which I like this

21
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,420
Weather Channel app better than this

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,210
weather I think it's more accurate for

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,379
whatever reason and then I have my drive

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,510
time app which is right here

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,420
I had to log all my drive time hours and

26
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,369
I use this app for that and over here I

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,170
have my photography folder which has my

28
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,450
three favorite photography apps I have

00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,679
Photoshop Express and it kind of has a

34
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,929
lot of options when you open it up and

35
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:27,029
you can click on the iPhone and you can

36
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:28,649
look through your photos and edit any of

37
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:30,359

I need in it now over here I have my

46
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,829
games folder which I only have one game

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,270
because I don't really play tons of

48
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,700
games on my phone but this game is

49
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,799
called best fiends and we kind of have a

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,969
family competition going and my parents

51
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,219
got me addicted to this game and

52
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,840
currently I'm on level 10 so I'll start

53
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,719
playing this game to show you guys kinda

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,149
how it works so the goal is to defeat

55
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,590
five slugs and collect 15 leaves so I'm

56
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,390
just gonna play the game and get as many

57
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,989
points as I possibly can to reach those

58
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,250
goals

59
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,510
I'm also going to try to get the diamond

60
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,069
because that's really good on this game

61
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,599
that's like one of the major goals of

62
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,459
this game along with these goals and

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,459
defeating five of these slug guys

64
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:38,700
and boom I win the level and now I'm

65
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,620
going to go over to my education folder

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,749
the first app is Goodreads which I

67
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,069
absolutely love and I have all of the

68
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:46,500
books that I've read on here documented

69
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,959
and I've given them ratings and I can

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,489
get recommendations and I can walk all

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,219
my books and I just love this app so

72
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,049
much because I love reading I also have

73
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,730
my Kindle app in this folder which I

74
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,260
love I'm currently reading a book right

75
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,519
now on my phone and it's throwing a

76
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,650
glass so if any of y'all haven't read

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,560
that I definitely recommend it and then

78
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,169
I have my iBooks app in here as well so

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,199
most my education is just ebooks and now

80
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,459
on to social media so I have Instagram

81
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,900
on here which they just changed their

82
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,949
little app pictures so that's what it

83
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,379
looks like now if you guys haven't

84
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,639

92
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:34,769
favorite app I just like scrolling

93
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,989
through Twitter and then I have snapchat

94
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:38,280
and snap upload which snap upload is

95
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,680
where I can just have a picture on my

96
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,849
phone and then upload it to snapchat so

97
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,519
I don't have to take the picture on

98
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:47,129
snapchat to upload it and then I have my

99
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,199
youtube studio app which just lets me

100
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,329
look at all the videos I've uploaded and

101
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,400
the statistics on those videos and the

102
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,870
comments on those videos and I like this

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,000
app because I'm youtuber as you guys

104
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,359
know and then I have other options on

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,909
the side of the app and then I just have

106
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,349
my regular YouTube app Facebook and then

107
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,509
Facebook mentions which is kind of like

108
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,669
a creator version of Facebook and then I

109
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:10,739
have Pinterest which I always get so

110
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,139
many notifications from Pinterest but I

111
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,969
love Pinterest so it's okay and now my

112
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,400
next folder is my music folder and I've

113
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:19,409
Spotify and me and Bailey obsessively

114
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,269
you Spotify so if y'all have it using

115
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:22,949
you should definitely use it and we can

116
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,199
just see like you can look at your songs

117
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,479
and you can look at your playlist and

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,900
your artists and you can play songs

119
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,900
based off that

120
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,990
then I just have my Apple music app

121
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,180
which I only have a few songs on there

122
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,120
and then I have Shazam which I

123
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,190
absolutely love Shazam because you can

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,450
just tap on this and it will listen to a

125
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,740
song right now it's just listening my

126
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,470
voice but it can listen to a song and

127
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,820
then tell you what song that is you

128
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,710
don't have to keep track of it anymore

129
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,300
and we can look at mine I've tagged a

130
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,380
few in here and then you can just click

131
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,880
on them and they'll play you like a

132
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,860
little sample of the song and then you

133
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,510
can add it to your Spotify or your

134
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,370
playlist or whatever you want then I

135
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,010
just have a regular guitar tuner app and

136
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,410
then a ukulele tuner app which is just a

137
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,060
regular ukulele and then shows me the

138
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,430
four notes that I need to play to tune

139
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,020
my ukulele obviously then I have my

140
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,150
Sonos app which connects to the speakers

141
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,620
in my house and then I have my musically

142
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,419
app which Billy and I just created

143
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,310

my school apps are in one school folder

147
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,910
so I have power school which is kind of

148
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,350
where I just can go online and look at

149
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,580
my grades which we're not going to do

150
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,710
because of summertime and I don't want

151
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,930
to think about grades and then I have

152
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,880
the Google Drive app which just kind of

153
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,470
has all of my folders for school in it

154
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,600
and my teachers can share documents with

155
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,520
me and as you can see like this is all

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,590
my homework which looks awful right now

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,930
because it's summer but that's all like

158
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,330
the stuff I did last year and then I

159
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,160
have Google Documents which lets me edit

160
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,380
documents on that app and then I have

161
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,780
Google Chrome and a scientific

162
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,250
calculator as well in case I need it at

163
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,550
any point in life and I don't have a

164
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:06,440
calculator on me and then here comes

165
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,330
just the classic app so I have Netflix

166
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,710

170
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:19,550
super-fun app it shows you the Stars so

171
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,229
if you point it at the sky it'll take

172
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,150
the stars you're looking at and connect

173
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,979
the dots and show you the constellation

174
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,389

175
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,340

handy-dandy multi case which I

204
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:27,390

205
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,550
64% on my phone so down here is the

206
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:31,890
battery pack on my Mophie so right now

207
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,260
it's only halfway charged but if I flip

208
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,670
this button over to the green it's going

209
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,130
to start charging my phone so it's

210
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,270
charging my 64% and it's going to charge

211
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,130
it all the way up to a hundred percent

212
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,660

213
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,640

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,010

My Virgin Kitchen is a YouTube cooking channel created when I wanted to teach myself how to cook and create a video diary of the journey https://www.youtube.com/user/myvirginkitchen. I have never had a professional lesson & am just your every day chap attempting recipes to inspire you guys to try too. I upload 2 recipe videos per week, but some fun is had too on Sunday when it is Funday where anything goes....including giant foods, mini foods, taste testing foods sent from around the World, kitchen gadget testing and many more. Any requests for recipes / cool stuff you've seen let me know! I try my best to reply to as many comments as possible, but it is hard to as I am busy working on the next video, but please interact with eachother and be respectful :-)","1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
hey folks really sorry if some of you

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,490
have already seen this video I ran into

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,500
some technical difficulties and I had to

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,960
re-upload it but it's definitely worth

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,820
watching a second time enjoy how

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,519
everyone its Barry here welcome to my

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,680
virgin kitchen today we are testing some

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,660
more kitchen gadgets first things first

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,670
this is a sponsored video by best fiends

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,080
so thank you very much to them I'll come

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,000
on so in just a minute but it really

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,820
does help make getting these gadgets

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,619
possible first up we've got a stonking

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460
gadget but remember as always some of

15
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,109
these might help people with

16
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,910
disabilities and also there's an amazing

17
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,010
place full of all the other gadget

18
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,380
videos up here and down below right

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,969
let's get going first gadget we're

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,379
looking at we need to make a batter for

21
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,719
another gadget so that works really well

22
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,010
as this is one of those as seen on TV

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,239
ones it's a 14 inch easy whisk

24
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,610
instructions very simple you just push

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,440
down on the whisk and it should whisk

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,390
that's basically it you can do omelets

27
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,030
cream chocolate sauce smoothies or more

28
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,539
but we're going to make some egg waffle

29
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,309
batter I don't technically need to

30
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,880
separate these eggs but is a good excuse

31
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:09,750
to use this gadget again there it is

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,640
great thing there's gonna be much in the

33
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,619
packaging I mean it hardly ever is so

34
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,610
you get what you pay for right oh yes

35
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:27,540
quite a rustic fancy nostalgic handle on

36
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:29,880
it good grip how's that like thanks with

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,860
it so this is it we just stick it in

38
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:39,360
there and whisk it away it's a heck of a

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,400
workout I've got to say it would work a

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,170
lot better and probably quieter on a

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,790
plastic bowl but that has well it's an

42
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,930
absolute charmer but it will not stand

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,119
phoney lump-free

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,320
exactly how I need so I needed to make

45
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,110
that batter because we're about to make

46
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,460
an egg bubble waffle pan thing this is

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,009
the next gadget come all the way from

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,780
Japan or China I was expecting to come

49
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,000
as one pan but actually turned up like

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,070
this in a whole kit I've got to make it

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,140
myself so while I start to build it

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,299
here's a little commercial break from

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,569
today's sponsors so today's video folks

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,979
is sponsored by best fiends and if like

55
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,930
me and

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,989
like lizzy here you don't know what best

57
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,690
fiends is it's basically a really really

58
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,120
addictive puzzle gaming app where you

59
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,580
have to build up a team of fiends and

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,980
the feet float I know how that sounds

61
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,470
quite a strange context to understand

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,239
but trust me it's a really really cool

63
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,760
game so you basically have to match the

64
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,950
same color object certainly for mushroom

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,500
with each other to collect power-ups and

66
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,650
pass through the levels now when best

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,599
fiends first got in touch I was like

68
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,660
alright I'll give it a little try so I

69
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,590
downloaded it and have what I thought

70
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,660
was going to be like a little

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,700
five-minute session on it and it ended

72
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,590
up being committed for funnel and scale

73
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,329
like gaming sessions shit got my

74
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,819
headphones on and stuff it's fair to say

75
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm now a little bit addicted so what

76
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:06,629
started out with me trying to get to

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:10,920
level 5 level 10 level 20 level 40 and I

78
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:12,480
am now at the magical height of level 84

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,239
it's pretty much where mrs. Barry has

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,359
been on the sofa watching some sort of

81
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,530
random reality TV show or I've been

82
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,329
waiting for something to bake in the

83
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,450
oven I've been having a little cheeky

84
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:27,090
play with it I can't I cannot and as I

85
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,470
say I am now up to level 80 whore so if

86
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,790
you do download it let me know what

87
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,200
level you up to and then we can sort of

88
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,540
like compete against each other and then

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,950
that's it that is my life for Easter

90
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,840
there's an Easter a challenge where you

91
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,609
can win awesome Awards and apparently if

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,630
you complete all sixteen levels there is

93
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:44,160
a funny character to unlock I never been

94
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,959
that excited about bunnies in my life is

95
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,489
amazing if you pass that challenge

96
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,169
before I do all you did tweet me a

97
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,940
picture evidence of that I'm the jealous

98
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,709
of your bunny skills so in the

99
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,900
description down below there is a link

100
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,879
so you can go and download the game and

101
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,560
at least give it a go actually there's

102
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,319
some rewards and incentives now you can

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,480
get free gold and diamonds not actual

104
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,919
real gold or diamond otherwise that

105
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,690
would be very different indeed but they

106
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,010
are amazing in the game maybe they

107
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,790
really help you I need more diamonds

108
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,160
actually I seriously do love saying this

109
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,419
game I need to put it down so anyhow to

110
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
be honest during that break I didn't

111
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,780
build that thing at all let's do it now

112
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,669
where do we start there's no

113
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,760
instructions with it at all it's

114
00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:24,630
literally come with that welcome to DIY

115
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,970
your own house again

116
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:34,560
not even Lizzie helps me that brush I

117
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:38,190
guess handles or drumsticks screws no

118
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:43,500
one lays some sort of probe and this

119
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:46,650
must be the actual pan oh okay cool with

120
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,930
a bit of Japanese newspaper in there we

121
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,110
can have a little bit of the look at the

122
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,400
stocks and shares markets if you want so

123
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,950
effectively it's hinged here right we

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:04,140
lift it open to tune and we should go to

125
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,840
make an amazing waffle like that so how

126
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:11,040
can this be

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,270
okay so dirty as well for that don't

128
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,680
worry once again it will built I'm going

129
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,680
to give it a darn good wash and myself

130
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:25,260
right I think this is for lubricating

131
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,540
our pan and this I think is if good is

132
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,850
going to get so let's give everything a

133
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,530
wash yep he's still going strong as

134
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,060
standard isn't turning to really

135
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,190
practical video I feel like this has

136
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,650
actually come straight from the factory

137
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,480
like not even than any safety protocols

138
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,090
whatsoever so strain your promote the

139
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,040
production line into a box - mother -

140
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,870
kitchen just want to say right now if

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,910
this gadget works it could be the

142
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,130
greatest thing of all time if it doesn't

143
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,590
after that I think I have the greatest

144
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,960
gadget of all time so apparently what we

145
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,730
do is sorry I new stock bonus game now

146
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,930
found a recipe online to help me it

147
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,330
smells really good by the way really

148
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,490
custody and what we have to duplicate

149
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,620
the pan first hence our big paint brush

150
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,900
that came with it

151
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,430
preheat each half of the waffle pan on a

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,440
medium high heat for about one minute

153
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:18,030
alright so that's going to get warm and

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,980
turn over and warm the other side hung

155
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,510
for the other side this is where it's

156
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,950
going to get dangerous all right kids

157
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,890
cops go take the tape off the brush

158
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:30,000
we're going to boil inside that that

159
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,700
feels really nice

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,490
ready join her and then this side to

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,080
pour the butter into the middle of the

162
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,879
egg waffle pan and then immediately

163
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,530
you flip it over making sure to hold the

164
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,580
pan together tightly so it doesn't leak

165
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,580
cook for two minutes

166
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:53,729
teeny bit more than that let me close it

167
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:57,539
and then that's all over my table but

168
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,949
I'm going to carry on I put my handles

169
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,400
on wrong are going to come back to that

170
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:00,990
in a minute

171
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,430
it's not shutting flush I'm going to

172
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,860
show you the other gadgets then we'll

173
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,680
come back to this so we kind of did get

174
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,150
a bubbly effect um we'll come back to

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,889
that in just a minute now

176
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,169
have you ever been to a radish themed

177
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,060
dinner party and thought to yourself mmm

178
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,099
I would much prefer these radishes if

179
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,590
they were in the shape of Super Mario

180
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:22,379
mushrooms could this be the greatest

181
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,210
gadget of all time this is the ravenel

182
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,520
oh I've been or that word means

183
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:29,909
sounds like a ninja turtle radish shaper

184
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,830
create mushroom shapes from radishes or

185
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,129
multiple radishes should that difficult

186
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,270
radish I know okay looks like that

187
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,250
that's is that if we can make this work

188
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,370
this is going to be phenomenal basic

189
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:45,419
instructions on the back just snip snip

190
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,819
snip there is look at that it's just one

191
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,190
piece tool thing so the steps which I've

192
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,729
now managed to slice in half okay first

193
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,719
thing cut the top off the radish and

194
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,509
we're actually going to need the knife

195
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:59,490
in just a jiffy

196
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,860
press the cut edge into the serrated

197
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,909
Center okay so that's that raised bit

198
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,830
there flat edge into there we'll just

199
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:12,690
press it in oh no just kind of split my

200
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,879
radish ball just skim over that so it's

201
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,419
in holding the ravenel Oh in one hand

202
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:22,460
turn the radish clockwise into the blade

203
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,460
until it can go no further

204
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,969
right my stallion okay so that's your

205
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,269
blade inside it so we do need to twist

206
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:35,269
it

207
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:48,510
I've got a lot of radishes I'm supposed

208
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:50,490
to pull this out and it's supposed to

209
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,260
look like a perfect mushroom but just

210
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:57,570
I'm not not getting that vibe at moment

211
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,339
oh just a bow looks like a button

212
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,529
mushroom well we'll move on with this

213
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,540
shoddy looking thing anyway and then

214
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,610
basically to create the white circles we

215
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,810
use this little tool nipple bit on the

216
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,699
end so we just sort of go into it okay

217
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:15,870
that looks pretty neat that looks good

218
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:18,000
but the rest of it pretty friggin

219
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,209
shocking isn't it look at the Hat I

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,220
think I'm going to cut more going for a

221
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,930
much deeper cut so I come out of radish

222
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,040
festival and if that does exist I'd

223
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,880
imagine they will take these along with

224
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,709
them all right

225
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,660
this one I'm more confident about it's

226
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,870
going on here nice it hasn't broken so

227
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,949
I've been a slightly deeper cut oh

228
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,350
because it is actually can you see the

229
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,730
actual radishes come out that side and I

230
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,630
was wondering what was going on is it

231
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,949
magic it's like a radish pencil

232
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,390
sharpener one of the first gadget videos

233
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:48,300
ever did was the carrot sharpener with

234
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,550
Phoebe but this is actually can you see

235
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,100
that is coming out of this it's great

236
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,630
yeah because I can see the stems come

237
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:07,470
out right that side there as well so

238
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:08,310
let's um yes can you see that that's

239
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,550
much better

240
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,870
look at that yep that's a mushroom now

241
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,399
there's got a scoop out with this you

242
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,449
just pray that it doesn't break remember

243
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,279
the good old days when it used to be

244
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:20,399
things like the RO hooks they also feel

245
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:33,389
on a drone those were easy gadgets it's

246
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:35,190
going on top of a radish so I just gave

247
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:36,269
it a bit of a top and tail so I just

248
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:43,130
straighten the edge a little bit and

249
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:43,130
there we go we have a Super Mario radish

250
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:51,420
just trying to get one more done oh yes

251
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,160
that is much better that's good

252
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,519
you get a little radish late as well I

253
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,779
love it and anyone but I love it

254
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,700
here's a question for you if Michael

255
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,190
Jackson didn't take up scene but was

256
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,540
actually a nice expert now

257
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:09,750
he would use these these are no cry'

258
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,060
gloves basically they are gloves that

259
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,680
apparently you can use sharp objects I

260
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,170
did speak to my builders and they did

261
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,760
recommend not using an angle grinder but

262
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,990
more things like sharp knives so when

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,430
you're slicing which would have been

264
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,709
perfect for my radish moment right there

265
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,720
and these can prevent you from being cut

266
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:26,459
so we will start in a very simple knife

267
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,660
it's not made of steel or anything like

268
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,519
that I don't think unless it's really

269
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,870
finely woven sort of metally stuff I'll

270
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,760
add but um it feels very comfortable

271
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,490
kind of like toe to toe skis for my

272
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,250
hands so this is a like a butter table

273
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:42,140
knife and wouldn't really hurt anyway if

274
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,730
I did this who actually feels quite nice

275
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,250
uttering my own hand but there we go

276
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,350
this is a slightly smaller paring knife

277
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,459
that I just used on the radish a moment

278
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,730
looks quite big from there but it is

279
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:58,620
it's quite a small knife here we go I'm

280
00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:02,010
just going to go to top well I'm alive

281
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,620
personalized look okay that's really

282
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,860
really cool I can go like that and it's

283
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,360
not it's not those play with most people

284
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,180
but obviously this is what this guide is

285
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,699
intended for that is legitimately work

286
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,260
in that's really cool bigger knife but

287
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:17,579
this is my big boy knife so I've just

288
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,970
sharpened as well that I use the most

289
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,970
chalk and my veg and stuff so here we go

290
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:41,580
did you see that wow that is amazing

291
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,380
I've got loads more knives like reviews

292
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,610
but I want to try it finally with a

293
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,920
bread knife so yeah let's call that

294
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,390
serrated edge so you use that quite a

295
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:54,260
bit when you're slicing fresh loaves of

296
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:56,460
bread this could be quite useful oh wow

297
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,080
there is that initial fear we're like

298
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,970
I'm using a knife on my hand is this

299
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,880
dangerous but no these gloves they

300
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,860
called no crow gloves and that works a

301
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,980
charm and then you are optional back up

302
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,240
hey Jamal Michael Jackson just in case

303
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,030
you're wondering look my hand not a

304
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,250

17
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,239
that would be super duper amazing so

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,930
without further ado let's jump straight

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,930
up to the video submissions okay

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,410
did you know you can turn your iPhone

21
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,600
camera lens through the perfect macro

22
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,350
lens with it's simply just a drop of

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
water

24
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,220
amazing take a little drop of water

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,550
under your fingers and transfer this

26
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,039
straight onto your camera lens and now

27
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:15,110
you can take photos of something super

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,720
small and close up so I'm going to give

29
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,280
you guys this comparison before they

30
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,799
water drop and after the water drop you

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,439
can see the veins on this little bugs

32
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,509
wing it is simply insane how detailed

33
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:26,930
this lens has become just from the drop

34
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:30,890
of water

35
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:33,409
so I'll just just here two tables turn

36
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,689
so I always end up eating when I'm using

37
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,670
my phone and I like my fingers get so

38
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,140
sticky and grubby and then I just like

39
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,060
put it on my phone screen and it's

40
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,829
really disgusting and I give long nails

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,320
like me you might make it hard to play

42
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,380
sized games and with this DIY you can

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,060
make your own iPhone stylus out of just

44
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,460
regular things around the house all you

45
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,100
need is a pen with a metallic casing a

46
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,409
sponge and some scissors so simply just

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,090
take the pen apart and make sure it's

48
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,860
actually like old metal because you want

49
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,350
it to conduct electricity from your

50
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,909
fingers then cut out a bit of the sponge

51
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,729
that's just a little bit bigger than the

52
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,590
opening of your pen and then stick it in

53
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,690
so a little bit of it sticks out it's

54
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,370
pretty much it and make sure your sponge

55
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,750
it just a little bit moist because we

56
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,209
need the water to conduct the

57
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,100
electricity as well and this is a

58
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:21,410
perfect hack to keep your screen clean

59
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,419
using this stylus to play best fiends

60
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,459
who've generously sponsored this video

61
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:26,190
I'd be like totally obsessed with this

62
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,930
game

63
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,970
so what'd you do it's really simple just

64
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,010
match the colors in a row this will mean

65
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,710
that your little bug army can defeat

66
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,350
like these giant ugly slugs and trust me

67
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,450
this is addictive I'm on level 41 right

68
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,640
now and tweet me your level as well I

69
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,200
want to see like how far you've gotten

94
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,150
summer when I heard the children are you

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,770
guys that like love exercise and you

96
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,720
don't have an arm band because it's too

97
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,420
expensive or you want your own custom

98
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,950
arm band all you need is a pair socks

99
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,510
and some scissors I think this is so

100
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,850
cute like almost lights down oh you need

101
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,190
to do is cut the sock off above the heel

102
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,380
so you just have this straight tube pull

103
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,120
it over your arm and then double it over

104
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,850
and that's pretty much your arm band

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,010
it's so simple slip your phone in and

106
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,660
basically wrap the top then what you

107
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,310
want to do is lightly mark the top or

108
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,620
your earphone jack is going to poke

109
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,930
through cut it and then like flip your

110
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,060
earphones in and that's pretty much your

111
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,010
arm band it's so simple it actually

112
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,750
feels more secure than I thought it

113
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,720
would especially since I have this like

114
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,639
monster iPhone six-plus and also baby

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,729
shoe

116
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,789
I'm excited for life too

117
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,860
cause our the bane of my existence

118
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:30,110
I suck at organizing cause I always have

119
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,849
electronics on my table like everywhere

120
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,680
it just gets in the way and I get

121
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:37,550
SuperDuper annoyed because the cord is

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,889
way to love all you need is a thick pen

123
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,110
and a hairdryer so all you need to do is

124
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,180
wrap the cord leaving the ends of the

125
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,639
cord that you actually need the length

126
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,800
of and wrap it around super super

127
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,870
tightly into this coil shape and then

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
take a hairdryer on the highest heat

129
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,409
setting and blow-dry it for a couple of

130
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,659
minutes make sure you don't burn

131
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:58,310
yourself our gloves or hold it in place

132
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,900
with something else because I don't want

133
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,479
you guys to hurt yourself after a few

134
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,150
minutes it keeps its shape and it

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,680
becomes super cute like springy cord I

136
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,389
just want to play with it I want to make

137
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,280

139
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,509

the flashlight and color it blue and

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,310

even drew all over my body and face just

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,950
to play with it it is so much fun

191
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,910
and syncing him/her bright I always

192
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,740
watch things on my phone either when a

193
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,750
huge laptop or computer screen is

194
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,220
literally right in front of me is

195
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,960
sometimes just easier because I'm

196
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,850
already on my phone or make any logical

197
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,380
sense for me to do this instead of

198
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,820
straining your neck down on your phone

199
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,740
you can actually make your own little

200
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,870
phone stand combined with speaker system

201
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,330
to hold it up all you need is a toilet

202
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,220
roll and two party cups cut a slit on

203
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,020
the toilet roll on the top and you can

204
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,840
mark this out so that your iPhone can

205
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:54,740
fit perfectly in place then cut a circle

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:56,780
in each of these sides of the cup and

207
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,000
then fit them together and you have a

208
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,380
really cool holder and speaker system

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,600
everything about this as you color it

210
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,010
and design it to whatever like theme you

211
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,210
have in your room at the moment how's

212
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:11,690
the intuition your over boy Lida

213
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:14,030
knowledge to DIY I have for you guys is

214
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,250
this awesome home projector for your

215
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,750
iPhone and to make this is actually

216
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,820
really really simple you just need an

217
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,360
old shoebox or hard board box a

218
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:26,540
magnifying glass tape scissors and some

219
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,160
play-doh to trace out a circle in the

220
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,410
front of your box in the shape of your

221
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,030
magnifying glass and cut out and opening

222
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,200
for it and make sure this is not too big

223
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,390
because you don't want the magnifying

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,550
glass you like move around a lot now

225
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,700
tape the magnifying glass in place from

226
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,770
the back and you have your projector

227
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,680
lens now turn the lights off and use a

228
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,960
blank wall or a white cardboard to set

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,640
up your own movie screen to make this

230
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,530
super clear you just need to shift the

231
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,210
phone back and forth to the perfect

232
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,580
position as well as the projector and

233
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,530
once you get this right you just

234
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,180
basically use your play-doh to keep it

235
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,520
in place because a magnifying glass

236
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,410
actually flips the image upside down I

237
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,540
have no idea why but it just does need

238
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,400
to turn on the assistive touch function

239
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,460
on your iPhone so that you can rotate

240
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,950
the screen the white the right the right

241
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,080
way around on the projector and you can

242
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,150
like watch movies YouTube or whatever

243
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,040
it's really really cool especially if

244
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,600
you have friends over and make sure your

245
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,460
phone is on the brightest setting as

246
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,620
well so you can see this clearly I

247
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,390
actually thought this wasn't going to

248
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,280
work because I've seen this fail so many

249
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,530
times and it's true like shuffle it so

250
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,520
we could actually see the screen this is

251
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,520
like so awesome guys

252
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm going to show you this DIY lava lamp

253
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,310
all you need is some cute clear bottles

254
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,770
baby oil food coloring and alka-seltzer

255
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,660
so fill up your bottles two-thirds of

256
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,340
the way up with baby oil and the rest

257
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,410
with water so the reason we're doing

258
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,610
this is the oil and the water don't like

259
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,460
each other so they're not going to mix

260
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,290
together and it keeps the color away

261
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,540
from the baby oil drop a few drops of

262
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,150
food coloring into the water and

263
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,750
seriously this process is a piece of art

264
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,120
in itself

265
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,280
we literally stood there and watch the

266
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,320
food color explode into the water so

267
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,120
many times but it just ended the DIY

268
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,820
here and we would have had so much fun

269
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,800
but I'm gonna put down the recipes for

270
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,120
these colors that I made on the screen

271
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,310
for you guys so you guys can make your

272
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
own all you need to do to make it go

273
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,450
library is to add a tablet of

274
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,090
alka-seltzer to make your love a lap

275
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,730
dance now so you're pretty good but to

276
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,040
make this DIY pop even more pop your

277
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,500
iPhone flashlight underneath while it's

278
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,690
on and it'll just light it up like this

279
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,850
magical lamp it's aside to be seen I

280
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,770
actually think this green color looks a

281
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:50,960
radioactive the purple one looks

282
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,370

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,850
truthfully you win ten pounds if you

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,609

thinking is what if she didn't have ten

pounds to start with to sacrifice that

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,680

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,680
time around he didn't really have a

62
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:44,980
choice in her defense Rosie like this

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,209
arc away actually it is like you've

64
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,560
channeling mother I think she's feeling

65
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:54,730
like Oh God

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:57,430
hi yeah yeah yeah it's the way you tell

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,989
a bit the backstory um basically I'll

68
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,720
take it the break and I have a tradition

69
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,299
where we give Shannon a Polaroid of a

70
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,860
naked very important the tradition is

71
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:08,049
damage from when we were at a house at

72
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,630
one time and we decided we'd leave a few

73
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,880
around in various places because we

74
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,980
thought that was funny now Shannon just

75
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,040
one celebrity rising star the British

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:21,040
LGBT Awards and we thought that was the

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,410
perfect opportunity to gift her alright

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,989
yeah so right the award without one

79
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,269
aliens a random room and Shannon was

80
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,799

102
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,890

103
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,900

156
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,710
feel like money is everything it's a

157
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,990
free addicted publican so I just feel

158
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,700
like having you in my videos having that

159
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,160

pedal a lot of money to measure them you

161
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,960

162
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:23,790
in my heart yes do you have a private

163
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:26,730
Twitter account no no yeah i 100% have a

164
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:30,180
private percent account and on that

165
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:33,090
private sector account nothing happens

166
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,070
because I have no private drama to

167
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:41,220
discuss I want to make a private

168
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:43,080
Instagram I feel like new who was the

169
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,300
last one you texted other than me

170
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Shannon I've got a text read of you and

171
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,280
Shannon and I just got me a John you put

172
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,480
one why'd you just got you in Charlotte

173
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,400
because he didn't have your number

174
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,080
before I don't know why shouldn't you

175
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,790
idiot and consider your friends before

176
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,530
but she didn't have your number before

177
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,040
she came to England which is really

178
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,620
strange

179
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,180
the last guy like pepper Shannon and I

180
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,340
said Thank You Shannon

181
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,650
for taking the picture that technically

182
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,950
the most successful Instagram post I've

183
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,230
ever uploaded thanks for your amazing

184
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,940
composition with photography what's that

185
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,180
you're not even a real model

186
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:22,290
again have you ever put something online

187
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:27,840
and wished that you hadn't yeah

188
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:29,780
is it your channel no I had to delete

189
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,940
some tweets I would say what they were

190
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,550
but this is a spawn video is that what

191
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,240
really happens with Taylor Swift and

192
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:42,090
your wedding duty oh okay our wedding

193
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,800
video got like muted and it's been taken

194
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,220
down again by the way someone showed it

195
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,830
up again by arisia yeah and then we read

196
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,970
and then we read this like a school that

197
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,860
have been written saying that Taylor

198
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,510
sort of suing us for copyright and we're

199
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,340
like oh that makes total sense because

200
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,930
we danced to want her songs in our

201
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,600
wedding videos for the whole song so

202
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:03,060
alcohol that makes sense yeah and also

203
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,700
Taylor's been known to take people's

204
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,350
videos down and parody videos down so

205
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,210
we're like okay she's removed our videos

206
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,250
in our defense a lot of big media

207
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,380
outlets tries to talk to us about this

208
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,760
and we've said absolutely not first of

209
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,140
all we didn't wanna draw attention to a

210
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,630
second of all we were a hundred percent

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,830
sure what Afghani was swimming on tumblr

212
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,920
always wonder what our wedding video

213
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,780
back we we said to it like look it's

214
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,640
probably not Taylor's fault

215
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,990
or just like time management or yapping

216
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,460
has just done it like and sure she

217
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,380
doesn't even know about it I guess the

218
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,090
whole world jump to conclusions what

219
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,890
Taylor Swift was the problem for

220
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:38,190
basically Rose dint look at her back end

221
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:40,230
and she went and look for of YouTube can

222
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,000
you let me tell story and then wrote it

223
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,800
on the back end off on her YouTube video

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,380
is like oh it's where I am in the back I

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,720
pee for like three seconds of this 2008

226
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,950
song looks like so old and this is after

227
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,710
all these articles have been written

228
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:55,080
things like trended on tumblr okay let's

229
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:57,030
work horrible he does it like love you

230
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,860
know she's all like no you can't use my

231
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,930
music your beautiful perfect wedding

232
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,610
wasn't her at all and I had such a panic

233
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,210
attack because I thought I'd upset

234
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:11,940
Taylor Swift right I I literally I threw

235
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,590
up three times I literally saw starvin

236
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,660
eyes I threw up I had to go to the

237
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,390
Twitter we write about management I was

238
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,960
crying and I was like tale about me I've

239
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,230
ruined it with her

240
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,300
so Paila strict management emailed our

241
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,190
management instead I came a hundred

242
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,080
percent confirmed this has nothing to do

243
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,670
with us yeah we were like but they were

244
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,680
really nice how are they want to take a

245
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,300
photo they were like it's not us but

246
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,710
maybe check your back oh I think that's

247
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,210
why you checked your back-end because

248
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,950
they're like maybe tub and lurk and

249
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,720
spear it could be another people and I

250
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,240
think they were like it might have been

251
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,890
torn out and they looked into it so I

252
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,320
would like to formally apologize to

253
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,480
Taylor Swift we have a subsequent

254
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,790
everyone did it wasn't as intact we love

255
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,160
you we do love you and that's why we've

256
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,110
danced your song at our wedding and do

257
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,720
it again it's not worth a expected

258
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,520
Taylor out of all the lesbian youtubers

259
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,180
which one do you think is the funniest

260
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,040
flash makes for funniest content the

261
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,260
funniest content and I think Ali Hills

262
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,330
makes great funny content hmm I think

263
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,670
Shannon is making really funny content

264
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,340
and Amy ottoman is making funny content

265
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm a huge fan as the Amy Ordman tiny

266
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,170
car viral video I'm a huge fan I love I

267
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,870
think that I cry at the fact that there

268
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,850
just sat in a tight car yeah that for me

269
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,660
is enough yeah I think I could say

270
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,210
anything

271
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,130
that's hilarious yeah oh and reacting to

272
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,980
how all the pictures also you can only

273
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:36,440
take one are we going with Tanika I'm

274
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:39,710
going with Amy Ottoman and her tiny car

275
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:44,630
have you ever looked at social grave and

276
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:48,290
cry love Greenlee yeah there are even if

277
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:50,930
you were to lose 5,000 a day on upload

278
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,140
that's what you're inside channel 2

279
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,490
I think I'd be very upset if I lost that

280
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,400
really yeah really

281
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,500
I'd be upset if I I'd be upset by did

282
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,050
something that offended most people to

283
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,640
unsub but I do it be more excessive if

284
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:06,200
they just saw you if you were just being

285
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,940
you happy-go-lucky you

286
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,440
yeah but then I don't think I cry about

287
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,730
that I think if it's not meant to be I

288
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,960
think if people don't want to watch

289
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,660
anymore that I don't want to do it

290
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,800
anymore like I would that's a really

291
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,540
good attitude oh yeah Alison yeah be

292
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,270
slightly upset you had these ideas that

293
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,630
yeah I cried I would shed thousand tears

294
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,490
not my thing your popularity like Jimin

295
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,890

a previous video I've done I always

110
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,310
think it's cool when teachers keep up to

111
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,019
date with like you know current trends

112
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,700
and current music so the fact that this

113
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:56,049
teacher actually understood what the kid

114
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,880

115
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,470

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,729

put it up next to their name on the

133
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,840
chalkboard and I just this is a way that

134
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,250
you would know if anybody is texting you

135
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,200
know another student you know if their

136
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,090
phone goes off and you can catch them do

137
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,460
you'll know if they're cheating dude

138
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,860
that's scary like just imagine if you

139
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,600
like plotted to cheat on a test with one

140
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,430
of your friends from another class and

141
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,560
he's trying to text you the answers

142
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,510
you're in class your phone is popped up

143
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,100
against the board and then dude if the

144
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,050
teacher sees that you know the answer

145
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,130

148
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,060

155
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,910

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,960

elevators now it's Lincoln there's so

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,020

41
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,380
with the first elevator being the normal

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,060
elevator okay so one thing that I

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,060
definitely do know about the normal

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,000
elevator is it plays copy written music

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,130
like it just was right there see if I

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
could

47
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,240
elevator music settings off okay but

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,990
then how come I still heard music

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,590
oh okay nevermind nothing copy written

50
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:26,780
yet ooh hold on this seems spooky oh

51
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,570
right it's Jason with the chainsaw and

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,820
then oh my goodness

53
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,680
geez and then he's gonna come this way

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,240
as well does he just come right through

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,730
the yep he just comes right through the

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,230
tents guys terrifying oh I forgot he

57
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,910
does that oh oh he just missed it it's

58
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:48,140
okay we're all good that's it right

59
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:52,190
that's the end of the we're good this

60
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,910
guy's just like a mist of all just you

61
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,160
do realize hold on that could very well

62
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,420
be copy written music this will be

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,780
really difficult I need to make sure

64
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,880
that's the in-between segments I quickly

65
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,420
mute the audio but then when we're

66
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:13,520
actually on the floor I turn it back on

67
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,130
because ooh boy it is it is quite the

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,200
predicament here okay like for example

69
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,480
right there interstellar soundtrack but

70
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,720
it's but we can still kind of get a

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,600
similar ie we can get the idea without

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:36,640
the music the music definitely helps but

73
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:40,220
seeing the black hole that it's Oh mmm

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,410
I'm actually drinking tea right now that

75
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,680

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,140

79
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,110
drinking tea when you're already in a

80
00:03:53,990 --> 00:04:00,110

81
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,840

203
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,040

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,680
to taste like

49
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,479
I have no idea so I have a picture we're

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,400
only going to obviously put in a little

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,110
bit at a time because all these things

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,910
are going to fit in here so just a

53
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,800
little fish splash splashing flute I

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,380
don't say we start out with the pretty

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,240
colors and then we'll move on to this

56
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,110
dark because I feel like it's just going

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,350
to turn black but surf is nothing to

58
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:35,100
lose on YouTube voltage I haven't sold

59
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:37,430
it in so long by the way the memory true

60
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,430
Satine

61
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:50,560
oh if we have pink talaq purple okay so

62
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:55,180
this is the fonta fruit punch Jenny

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,840
[Music]

64
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,480
not my favorite

65
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,130
okay let's add some green Mountain Dew I

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,690
don't know what color green and purple

67
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:09,230
knife I don't think it's not pretty

68
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:12,800
oh no I really did

69
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,140
Oh legend ugly color now

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,630
okay let's add some squirt which I think

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,000
squirt is a California drink because I

72
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:25,370
never knew about the world show here so

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:32,019
oh hi oh my gosh should use like aqua

74
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:35,989

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:38,269
up next we'll add some 7up 7up in Frank

76
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:42,519

77
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:47,060
oh there's a difference

78
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:49,640
7-up tastes black or sprite in right

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,350
it's the drinks of my dad always let me

80
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,930
have because it doesn't have caffeine in

81
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,520
it so going to McDonald they never order

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:00,200
coke which is a sign I don't really like

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,780
let's ask mountain to coal Brad which

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:09,590

flavor as frightening that's delicious -

91
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,510
so crows all together or maybe I'll

92
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,570
invent a new tree so we have two oranges

93
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:40,340
we have sentence and dance on pretty

94
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:46,850

95
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:53,540
a Fanta use cotton on that posture to

96
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:58,820
prevent a fast effective I prefer Fanta

97
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:02,660
honestly focus on that rate Fanta orange

98
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,850
so that is where spray cherry oh my gosh

now we've made it to our dark soda what

108
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,950
you think about it the fact that we're

109

putting black liquid into our bodies

110
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,070
Halloween's not very good for you right

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:49,460
we'll start with root beer this Ruby

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:54,050
Rose cream soda deletion

113
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,050
okay now we're going to do root beer

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:16,710
time for the big moment of group the

130
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:20,960
kind of victim T is that the brown color

131
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:30,900

we hold on

136
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:42,410
but it wasn't a flight

137
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,900
[Music]

138
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:51,170
I can even but I'll work to it and he's

139
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,560
the UM the voltage and he's the dr.

140
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,980

141
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,010
coke

142
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,890
I'm literally tasting them all this is

143
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,890
so weird and bizarre look exactly tweet

144
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:11,230
subletting slick there's a long sugar

145
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:17,110
expand my tea from your own uh-oh not

146
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:17,110

honestly it kind of makes me feel all

148
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,350
fit if I had to give it a believer I

149
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:31,300
would say the two strongest things are

150
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:34,630
not too neat dr. pepper and root beer I

151
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,039
think the root beer overpowers a lot

152
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,720
okay so you're probably wondering Joey

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,940

to the mixture at the end so it's going

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,059

so basically best fiends is an adventure

34
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,100
puzzle game where you collect beans to

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,990
defeat the bad evil slugs by matching up

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,700
the same color objects and the more you

37
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,380
connect the harder you hit and this

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,780

diamonds alright well let's get on with

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,549
the DIY I'm excited to make this rainbow

54
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,590
gorgeousness so let's get to

55
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,550
okay so first things first you're going

56
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,950
to need it one whole cup of glue this is

57
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,980
a large dick off so basically that

58
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,450
equals 8 ounces of glue if you don't

59
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,660
feel like measuring cupping it would I

60
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:29,129
don't oh yeah crazy scientists back with

61
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,379
his experiment oh oh oh this is already

62
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,310
off to a great start Joey all right

63
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,310
here's the second one

64
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,519
rate see I'm not cranky okay cool next

65
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,920
we add half a cup of water just splash

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,329
it on in and this is pretty much the

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,819
stuff that I've gotten to with all the

68
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:50,579
other bowls for the color so from here

69
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,900
on out no idea what's going to happen so

70
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:56,280
let's just mix this up

71
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,090
just water include mmm delicious

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,190
okay so the next step is so weird okay

73
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,069
you have to add shaving cream to get

74
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,459
fluffy slime so I'm just using the bar a

75
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,030
girl farm over here soothing aloe so we

76
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,549
need it

77
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,130
three to four to have a cups of this

78
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,319
which that seems like a lot where's my

79
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,239
measuring cup four words right here okay

80
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:28,859
all right are you ready for this

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:32,340
come on Shane is gonna be annoying girl

82
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:35,250
in school as a kid they would have a

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,650
house cleaner does the shaving cream you

84
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,470
could like play in it and make shapes

85
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,209
and all these weird designs and stuff

86
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,620
honestly if that was a very smart move

87
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,349
for the teachers I don't know how

88
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,050
shaving cream clean there's alcohol or

89
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:52,120
something in there

90
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:54,970
um but there's child labor okay so

91
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,860
that's two cups how many three this is

92
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,140
so weird who would have thought this oh

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,990
let's put shaving cream with glue and

94
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,820
water and it makes frickin slime okay

95
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:06,040
the next thing i'm ian is contact

96
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,140
solution so you're supposed to add two

97
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,930
tablespoons of that oops

98
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,060
hope i'm enough for although there's one

99
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,370
and there's two

100
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:24,760
mix that up this is a lot look I still

101
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,190
have four more of these holy crap I'm

102
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,590
probably not going to do those on camera

103
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,460
with you guys but it will be done don't

104
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:37,120
worry and then the last ingredient is

105
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,550
two to three tablespoons of borax so I

106
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,250
already mixed it with water before this

107
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,040
video so we're good on that

108
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:51,640
wait this was too slowly for us so I'll

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:54,720
just do one at a time who is trying to

110
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,970
get to slime oh my gosh okay alright

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,410
alright I'm getting excited so basically

112
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,480
we're just going to keep mixing it until

113
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,700
it's not sticking to the sides of the

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,580
bowl so I guess that's probably how you

115
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,480
figure out how much borax you need which

116
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,230
let's stick in it's real fluffy holy

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,740
crap

118
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,690
gosh so difficult to mix now okay I feel

119
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:22,140
actually done I feel like she's had

120
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:24,930
enough she was a big ball of fluff

121
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,190
all right about this okay so actually

122
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,290
I'm just going to add the food coloring

123
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,060
and now we're going to start with our

124
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,060
green color just because this is my

125
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,530
favorite so let's just add some drops

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,870
maybe we should have done this before I

127
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,970
don't know this will find out I made a

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,380
mistake okay I'm just going to dig in

129
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,390
with my hands on this one they're

130
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,070
probably going to get died I don't have

131
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,590
gloves so you know what let's just

132
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:51,060
smooth it out a little bit and how far

133
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:53,280
oh gosh this is seriously so fucking

134
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,040
fluffy alright let's just take our help

135
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,200
oh it feels so cool okay I don't know if

136
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,920
this is actually going to mix in with

137
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,170
the color

138
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:06,000
oh no it's not crappy screwed up guys

139
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:09,900
we should have add the food coloring in

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,090
way before okay um so we're just going

141
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,770
to retry this sadly this is how it

142
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,960
turned out it it's kind of cute it's

143
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,750
like a marble look so this was at at

144
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,750
number one oh okay we learned our lesson

145
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,079
[Music]

146
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,880
[Music]

147
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:43,740
all right so that second time definitely

148
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,340
it turned out much better and I was able

149
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:50,039
to add in the foam little beads so this

150
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,630
is the final result of the blue it's so

151
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,810
thick and fluffy

152
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,970
I am so obsessed with it it's so cool

153
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:03,780
I've actually so many videos of people

154
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:09,270
doing this oh this is all I ever wanted

155
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:12,319
to do and they go like this they fold it

156
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:16,860
in just like that

157
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:20,520
do it again oh I love it

158
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:24,389
okay so now I'm going to make the five

159
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,759
other four other colors and then we'll

160
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:32,780
see what all them looked like together

161
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,780
yeah let's do it

162
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,480

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:15,259
make a heart and it's ripping more okay

169
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,009
I think at the end I'm going to combine

170
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,630
them next is the green one which is

171
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,370
turning like a frickin shamrock shake

172
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,090
when I was making this I made me very

173
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:32,209
very hungry and in need of a a green

174
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:34,909
unhealthy extreme oh it feels really

175
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:35,959
good it's like a little bit of an

176
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,260
exfoliation

177
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,180
up next is orange

178
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,190
she's like a liquidy one I don't know

179
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,709
why prom went wrong with her but she's

180
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:55,060
like squirmy wormy up in here but she's

181
00:08:48,709 --> 00:09:00,230
still sweet look at it it's so straight

182
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:06,079
yeah that's a snake oh it's actually

183
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:08,690
like a giant poop oh well it works one

184
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,520
for I got I feel like I like didn't put

185
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,040
enough force or something in this one

186
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,829
and last but not least is a purple

187
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,510
nurple oh this one turned out really

188
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,450
good actually I'm obsessed with this

189
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,399
color it's so frickin pretty alright I

190
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,990
think they all definitely are a little

191
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,540
bit differently some orange on that

192
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,050
which cover that up never happened

193
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,690
oh he's going in there okay now it is

194
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,720
time for the moment to combine them all

195
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,369
together so we're gonna go in order so

196
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,639
it will be red or pink and then we'll do

197
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:43,389
lil the sky gets filled color this one's

198
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,429
so pretty

199
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,389
the orange bourbon got into everyone

200
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:49,209
else's business

201
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:51,129
orange needs to mind itself ok and last

202
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:56,110
but not least is purple

203
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:59,619

204
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,449

214
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,579
this is my all-time freakin favorite

215
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,699
slime I've ever done holy frickin crap

216
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:48,160
okay well it looks like pants little

217
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:50,170
ruin rainbow pants on the table

218
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,139
okay let's start mixing them all

219
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:58,540
together bad end this okay it's slowly

220
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,490
becoming all of color I don't know how I

221
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,639
feel about the orange being in the mix

222
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:07,540
of all this but you know what too late

223
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,249
now okay this is a very pretty color the

224
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,019
light green with the teal it's like a

225
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:14,920
little tight eye action we have going on

226
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:20,079
it looks like frickin rainbow sherbert

227
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:24,160
oh crap no don't attach to my clothing

228
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,649
okay well it's turned into a fuel mess

229
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,399
um so I would recommend if you're going

230
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,199
to make all these colors to just um kind

231
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,709
of the orange the orange is pretty

232
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,720
overpowering um so I'm going to cover

233
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,669
just end this video here look at this

234
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,009
it's a giant pop it looks like a big

235
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:45,609
piece of bubblegum just like that you

236
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:48,939
spin out okay so I let Daniel take over

237
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:51,639
for a bit and he made these beautiful

238
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:56,759
things so this is without orange look

239
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:56,759
how pretty it is this looks so yummy

240
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:04,959
this looks like frickin unicorn damn

241
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,809
poop if I've ever seen unicorn poop okay

242
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,839
let's roll it out next time definitely

243
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:20,309
not using orange this looks so pretty

244
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:25,119
look at that Oh looks so cool oh my gosh

245
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:27,999
that is sickening okay this one is so

246
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:31,929
much better than that raggedy big clump

247
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:33,730
of orange nastiness I think we know what

248
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:36,369

In collaboration with Best Fiends

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
Ok, here I am

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,760
Hello Frogs and Toads and welcome to this new and amazing GamePlay, I'm Fraffrog

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,900
And today I'm here to try this brand new game called Best Fiends. You can download it directly onto your smartphone

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact I have it right in front of me, so now LET'S PLAY

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,300
It's a really fun game and you can do many things

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,160
The goal is to form a long chain with these objects

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,800
In order to defeat the black snails aka ""Sluggs""

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,240
SO.. let's begin with level 1

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,640
What the...??

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,880
Fraffrog, there's no time. Please help us!!

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,720
What?!

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,220
I can't explain right now. Do you know what to do?

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,100
Emm.. No!

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,420
Very well! Be ready to fight then!

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,500
What are you talking about??!!! You came here from nowhere, without no explanation!

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't even know if you're just an hologram made by my phone and... Now What?!

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,000
IT'S COMIIIING!!!

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,840
nbrbhurihbnuirenb *random noises*

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,120
Well... Hello Mr. Evil Slugg and Welcome.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,500
If you could give us a moment, I have something to discuss with my collegue here. Thanks

22
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:27,500
Forget the apparition, forget the fact that I don't how I'll explain this to my phone's client assistance

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,580
But now, tell me, WHY are you here? WHAT do you want from me?

24
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,700
The Sluggs attacked Minutia falling from a meteor

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,420
With the less amount of words you are capable of

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,860
KILL HIM!

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Him?!

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,940
Yes!

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But he didn't do anything!

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,960
He's eating your computer!!

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
THEN HE DESERVES TO DIE!!

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,140
You, little thing, tell me what to do!

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,900
You have to link together as many objects of the same type as possible , like in the game

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,600
How can I do that?

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,100
With your finger, pretend that you're actually using your phone

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
WHAT?! He's bigger than before!

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,860
You have to make a far bigger chain if you want to destroy him

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
You have to find something really numerous

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,300
Ok, listen, I don't care. Eat whatever you want. You: are on your own. Bye. Adios

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,500
Wait. Please! Try to focus. You have to find something REALLY numerous

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,160
Otherwise the whole world will be in great danger!

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
*think think think*

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,000
By the power of the Coffee!

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Perfect, good work. Byebye

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,040
You're welcome!!

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
What?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
It is still recording?!

48
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,860
Hello Frogs and Toads and Thank you for watching this video

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,800
I remind you that if you'd like to buy this game you could find it in the description box of this video.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,500
I send you a hug and a little tender pat.

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,000
BYE!

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,460
No, no, no.. I'll never do a Game Play again. Too much labor

the kids are sleeping and it's mom time.

Mom's food, mom's game, mom's
favorite cute little fiends.

00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,565

you can use the included design template

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,190
or create your own design and that way

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,280
you can customize and personalize your

55
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,900
jewelry to any style you want make sure

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,850
you leave some room on both sides of the

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,519
rod so you tunic easily remove it from

58
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,560
the design station and let it dry on the

59
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,630

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,579
gently wriggle the beads off the rod but

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,859
be careful with the sinner designs guys

62
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,959

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,730

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,510
partner with these guys for months

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:29,730
because I'm on level 176 do you see this

12
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:31,740
level 176 boom I was even literally

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,239
planning the game at the exact moment

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,520
the best fiends followed me on Twitter

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,809
and I was already on mobile 89 so if you

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,160
don't already know best fiends as a

17
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,079
puzzle battle game with tons of

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,730
characters collect level them up and

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,700
defeat the slugs and there are seemingly

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,590
endless levels and side quests and when

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,559
you level up your characters they evolve

22
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,420
into more awesome chick but creatures

23
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,340

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,870

right there you want to check it out

82
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,360
I've never in my life felt so invested

83
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,950
in a TV show I was really invested in

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,230
Dexter and How I Met Your Mother

85
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,060
but this is a whole new level man

86
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,250
obviously I'm not gonna spoil anything

87
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,290
but I'm just I'm just so height about

88
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,510
the season and almost everything that's

89
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,239
happening in it every week I count the

90
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:22,560
days and I'm like only six more days

91
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:27,400

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,950
Sunday favorite book of this month goes

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,760
to how to ruin everything by George

94
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:36,610
Watsky I haven't read a book that wasn't

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,860
like a song of ice and fire or something

96
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,269
by JK Rowling in so long because I

97
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,730
always listen to audiobooks because I

98
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:45,400
like to multitask but George sent me his

99
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,459
book and I'm about halfway through now

100
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,860
and it's real good it's real good guys

101
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:54,670
I'm constantly impressed by watsky he

102
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:57,370
has such a gift with words that I cannot

103
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,160
comprehend and I'm just really really

104
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,190
respected very very skilled lyricist and

105
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,650
as it turns out story writer so yeah

106
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,530
check it out he's got some crazy stories

107
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,790
my Ganga backpack I don't go to school

108
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,010
anymore but whenever I have to carry

109
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,200
even a moderate amount of things I

110
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,260
use a backpack because that's just it's

111
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,180
more comfy and convenient for me and I

112
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,660
saw this on the internet and I could not

113
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,650
resist

114
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:25,540

115
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,680
just made a really creepy Gengar face

116
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,660
let's turn on the lights

117
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,340
favorite song goes to there would have

118
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,570
been nothing left to do for someone less

119
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,520
thus to he would have been dead or

120
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,650
destitute without a cent to restitution

121
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,990

mother's landlord trading sugarcane and

123
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,740
rum and other things that can't afford I

124
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,600
found bb-8 gummy vitamins at the grocery

125
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,419

130
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,449

00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:57,070

00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,700
Hey guys, it’s Ro! As many of you know,
I love the game Best Fiends,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,179
I play it a lot! Someone may be on level 414….

3
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,079
I love the character Howie, it’s my favorite
character, last time I showed you guys

4
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:18,619
he kind of looked like an apprentice, like a mage,
and he had little magic balls,

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:22,259
and now, I have leveled him up the highest
you can go right now!

6
00:00:22,259 --> 00:00:24,169
He looks like Gandalf the Gray!

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,150
Today, I wanted to make a video with Best
Fiends because they are doing something

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,890
really, really cool in honor of Earth Day.
They are running a charity campaign

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,180
called Apps for Earth, they’ve teamed up with Apple and the World Wildlife Fund.

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,440
For those of you who may not be familiar with
the World Wildlife Fund, they are a

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,469
charitable organization that helps to protect
the environment and all types of

12
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,620
life on earth, like the Panda bear, that’s
their little logo, they have a little Panda!

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,060
He's super cute!

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,379
It is a charitable organization that is near
and dear to my heart, so I wanted

15
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:59,199
to get involved. For this campaign, Best Fiends
has put together 15 bonus levels

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,250
which you get to play with cute little panda bear characters, aw!

17
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,730
From now until April 24th, if you purchase
a cute little panda bear character,

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,330
100% of the proceeds go to the World Wildlife
Fund.

19
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,190
I got really excited about this and I wanted
to get behind it and get involved,

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,480
So, I got all of the pandas, I have got all
of them.

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,280
They’re adorable, I wanted to show you guys
what they look like.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,070
There’s Lili, Bazoo, Scout, Leo and Daisy,
and they’re all friends!

23
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,830
And you can play with them!

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,670
Lili’s pretty cool too because she has these
two little purses on, and inside

25
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,150
she's got a lot of cupcakes in there, so she’s
my kind of gal!

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,460
Beyoooooo! Get ‘em Scout!

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,670
They’re teaming up with the bugs, to help
fight the slugs.

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,900
So in honor of the cute little panda bear
characters in the game

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,880
and the World Wildlife Fund, today we are
gonna be making some cute little DIY Panda Treats!

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,540
Let’s get started!

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,250
The first treat that we’re gonna be making
are these adorable Panda Macarons.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,460
The things that you will need will be: 3/4
Cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 a cup and

33
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:10,679
2 tablespoons of almond flour, 2 egg whites,
1/4 cup of sugar and some black food

34
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,060
coloring. And then for the filling, we will
need 1/2 a cup of heavy cream, 1 cup

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,120
of white chocolate chips. We will also need
a couple tips, I’ve got a #2A

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,709
and a #5 and some piping bags.

37
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,569
The first thing that we’re gonna do to make
our Panda Macarons, is, we’re going to

38
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,109
sift together our powdered sugar and almond
flour. Here, I’ve got a bowl in the

39
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,519
middle, with a strainer, I’m gonna pour
both of these in here.

40
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,230
And make it rain!

41
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,349
Make it rain, make it rain, make it rain,
make it rain!

42
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:41,489
Now we’re gonna gently mix this up and set
it off to the side.

43
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,739
Now we’re gonna make our meringue, the first
thing that you’re gonna do is

44
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:47,780
you’re gonna crack 2 egg whites into this
bowl.

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,719
We’re first gonna mix together our
egg whites, until they’re frothy!

46
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,790
This is what it looks like, kind of looks
like a bubble bath, it’s a bunch of bubbles.

47
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,359
Now we’re going to slowly add our sugar,
just drizzle it really lightly,

48
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,760
as we’re mixing, for about 3-4 minutes until
it forms stiff peaks!

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,340
Boom! We’ve got some peaks!

50
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,939
Now we’re gonna fold our dry ingredients
to our meringue.

51
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:15,469
And remember, you want to fold it in, I like
to do it in thirds, just eyeballing it.

52
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:20,909
And you cut it down the middle, and you fold
underneath and turn about halfway.

53
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,249
And keep doing this until it’s well incorporated.

54
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:26,650
We’ve got it all mixed up and now i’m
just gonna take a little scoop.

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,290
I’m just eyeballing it. We just need a little
bit to dye black.

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,760
I’m just gonna take a little bit of black
food coloring dye, add it to our batter.

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,019
Take a spoon, and mix it around.

58
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,480
Our batter is now ready, I’ve placed it
over here into 2 plastic baggies, with

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,510
tips at the end for a little bit more control.

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,529
On the white batter I have the #2A tip, and
on the black batter I have the #5 tip.

61
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,159
Over here I have a cookie sheet, lined with
a piece of parchment paper.

62
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,999
On the bottom side, ooop! I’ve traced a
bunch of little circles, they’re about

63
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:01,370
an inch and a half big, and then you want
to face them down.

64
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,010
So that whatever side you draw on is on the bottom
and not touching the food.

65
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,700
We’re gonna take a little bit of batter
and just put a little dab into each corner,

66
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,700
and stick it down.

67
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,049
Now we’re gonna pipe our panda cookies,
we’re gonna start with the white batter.

68
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:16,570
We’re just gonna fill in each circle.

69
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,230
We’ve got our cookies piped into the pan,
now we’re gonna give it a tap to get the

70
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,760
air bubbles out. This is loud, be careful!

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,260
Then you’re gonna take your black batter
and we’re gonna make the Panda’s ears

72
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,390
and facial features, but remember, we’re only
gonna be decorating half of them

73
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,670
with panda faces. Boop! Oh my gosh! So cute!

74
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,790
Once you’ve got your Pandas piped, now we’re
gonna let them sit out at room

75
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,720
temperature for about 30-40 minutes for them
to form a skin.

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,570
Once they’ve set, now we’re gonna bake,
you’re gonna heat your oven to

77
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,310
325 degrees and bake these cookies for about
12-18 minutes.

78
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,030
And, look at this, nifty trick, we’re going
to double pan it while we bake,

79
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,380
so that our macarons won’t burn at the bottom
and they will build taller feet!

80
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,340
While our cookies are baking, we’re gonna
be making out white chocolate ganache

81
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,920
filling. We’re gonna take our cream, a spatula,
our white chocolate chips, and

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,150
a pot, over to the stove!

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,380
To make our ganache filling, pour the cream
into the saucepan over medium-low heat.

84
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,030
Heat until it’s scalding, which is when
he teeny bubbles will start to form

85
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,160
all around the ring of the pan.

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,340
Then pour the warm cream over the white chocolate
chips and stir together

87
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,160
until smooth. Now we’re gonna place this
into the fridge to chill.

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,830
Our cookies have baked and I’ve given them
plenty of time to cool. And I just took

89
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,530
the ganache our of the fridge, put it into
a plastic baggie and I just cut

90
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,770
the tip to make it a little bit easier. Now
we are gonna assemble.

91
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,340
I’m just gonna pick up a bottom piece, put
a nice little layer of white

92
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,400
chocolate ganache, yum-yum-yum!

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,400
And then we’re gonna place on the top cookie.

94
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh my gosh, adorable!

95
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,030
Now we’re gonna do this to the rest of our
cookies!

96
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,920
And there you have it, here’s all of our
Panda Macarons that we made!

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,960
The next thing that we’re gonna be making
are Panda Panna Cottas!

98
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,160
Panda Cottas!

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,760
The things you will need to make the
Panna Cotta will be:

100
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,340
1 cup of milk, 1-1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1
cup of greek yogurt, 6 tablespoons

101
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,610
of water, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 packets of powdered
gelatine, 1 teaspoon of vanilla

102
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,060
extract, and 1 teaspoon of almond extract.

103
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,810
You will also need some white candy melts,
black candy melts, and, a silicone mold!

104
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,220
With these little 1/2 sphere cavities.

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,020
Then to make our brownies for the bottom,
you will need: 1 cup and 2 tablespoons

106
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,950
of sugar, 1/2 a cup of all purpose flour,
1/3 cup of dark cocoa powder,

107
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:47,220
1/3 cup of whole milk, 1/2 a cup of vegetable
oil, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon of vanilla

108
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,340
extract, 1/4 a teaspoon of salt, 1/4 a teaspoon
of baking powder, 3-1/4 inch

109
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,870
circle cookie cutter.

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,530
The first half of the treat is the panna cotta,
and that what we’re gonna make,

111
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,920
because it needs about 4 hours to set.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,110
So, you’re gonna take your little bowl of
water and we’re gonna add

113
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,000
both the gelatine mixtures to the bowl. Take
your spoon, mix together.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,520
Just put our gelatine off to the side, now
you’re gonna take your sugar,

115
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,000
cream, a whisk and pot over to the stove.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,200
Add the cream into the saucepan and then the
sugar.

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,830
Whisk together until combined and then turn
the stove onto medium-low heat.

118
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,370
Continue whisking until the sugar is completely
dissolved and the cream is warmed.

119
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,800
Then remove from the stove and back to your
baking station.

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
Just took our cream mixture off of the stove,
be careful because the outside of the

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,540
saucepan is hot, but our cream is very warm.
It’s interesting.

122
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,230
Just be careful, don’t get your fingers.

123
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:44,100
Now you’re gonna take your gelatin, add
it to your cream mixture, mix together

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,700
until the gelatine has fully melted.

125
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,040
Next we are gonna mix together some of our
wet ingredients, we are gonna mix

126
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,440
together our yogurt, our extracts, vanilla
and almond, and our milk into this

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,110
bowl right here. Then using a spatula, I’m
just gonna mix together.

128
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,620
Here’s our cream mixture, we’re gonna
add it to the bowl now.

129
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,010
Whisk together one more time until fully combined.

130
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,330
I transferred our Panna Cotta mixture into a measuring
cup because it’s a little bit

131
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,620
easier to pour into the molds because it’s
got a spigot.

132
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,030
And, we’ve got our mold, I put it on top
of a baking sheet so it would

133
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,190
sit flat, it would be even. And, I’m
gonna give it a quick spray before

134
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,160
we pour in our Panna cotta Mixture.

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,510
It’s now time to fill up our molds.

136
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,120
You’re gonna fill them all the way to the
top!

137
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,440
Once your mold is filled, we’re gonna place
these in the fridge to set for

138
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,289
about 4 hours. While our Panna Cotta is chilling
in the fridge, we are gonna make

139
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,430
some brownies for the bottom. Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum!

140
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,370
The first thing that we’re gonna do is whisk
together some dry ingredients,

141
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,399
in this mixing bowl right here. We are gonna
whisk together our flour, dark cocoa

142
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,339
powder, sugar, baking powder, and salty-salty…

143
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,080
Dink!

144
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,560
Then whisk together till everything’s
well combined.

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,550
Next we’re gonna add our wet ingredients
to our dry ingredients, it doesn’t matter

146
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,209
what order, I love this recipe, it’s really
easy!

147
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:11,629
We’re gonna add our oil, milk, vanilla,
and 1 full egg, and whisk together one

148
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,100
more time, until everything is well combined.

149
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,399
Our brownie batter is ready, now we’re gonna
pour it into our pan.

150
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,069
Over here I’ve got our pan, it is 8x8 inch
square pan, which I’ve lined with

151
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,249
a piece of parchment paper at the bottom.
And lightly sprayed it with

152
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,560
baking spray because we’ll want to pop out
our brownies easily after they’ve baked.

153
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,339
And now, we’re gonna pour it in! Fill ‘er
up!

154
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,600
Oh yum, you guys! This is like a chocolate
waterfall!

155
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,560
Our brownies are ready to bake, we’re gonna
heat our oven to 350 degrees and bake

156
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,259
for about 50 minutes. It’s a little bit
longer than normal, but it’s because we

157
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,379
want our brownies to be pretty dry, to hold
the Panna Cotta on top!

158
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,240
We took our brownies out of the oven, gave
it plenty of time to cool, I just popped

159
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,910
it out of the pan and placed it onto a cutting
board, I am now going to take the

160
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,149
circle cookie cutter, and cut out the bottom
base of our Panna Cottas

161
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,589
We cut out our brownies, our Panna Cottas
have set and now we’re gonna assemble

162
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,000
our… Panda Cottas!

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Ah! Hwah-hwah-hwah-hwah-hwah!

164
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,100
Alright, we’re just gonna pop these out,
I’m just gonna use my hands!

165
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,180
Ooooh! And, place it on top! Place it on top!

166
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,360
Now, time for my favorite part, it is time
to decorate!

167
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,100
I’ve got some candy melts that are black
that have not been melted. We’re gonna

168
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,009
use these for the ears. And then over here,
in these 2 little plastic baggies,

169
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:30,800
I have some black melted candy melts, and
white melted candy melt.

170
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,129
You only need a little bit, you really don’t
need a lot!

171
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:36,759
First thing I’m gonna do is place their
little ears, so you’re just gonna stick

172
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,759
2 in at the top. And now, I’m just gonna
eyeball it, and draw 2 eyes, and a nose!

173
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,540
Da-dew! Here are all of the Panda Cotta Treats
that we made!

174
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,290
The next thing that we’re gonna be making
are these yummy little Panda Pudding Cups!

175
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,309
The things you will need for the Panda Pudding
Cups will be: Some Oreos,

176
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,649
4 dessert glasses, then for the pudding you
will need 2 cups of whole milk,

177
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:07,309
1/3 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of corn starch,
2 pinches of salt, 2 tablespoons

178
00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:10,079
of butter, and 1/2 a vanilla bean.

179
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,800
Then for the whipped cream you will need 1
cup of heavy whipping cream,

180
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,569
and, 2 tablespoons of sugar. You’ll also
need some black candy melts, and a

181
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:20,670
1 ounce ice cream scoop.

182
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,550
The first thing that we’re gonna do, is we’re
gonna add our sugar, corn starch,

183
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:29,689
2 pinches of salt, and then I’m gonna whisk
together. Now I’m gonna slowly pour

184
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,009
the milk into the saucepan while whisking.

185
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,509
High pour! High pour!

186
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,959
After you’ve whisked everything together,
now we’re gonna add our vanilla bean!

187
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,749
Over here I’ve slit the vanilla bean down
the middle, the long way.

188
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:48,139
I’m gonna take a sharp cutting knife, and
scrape down to get all of the

189
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,629
vanilla beans out. We’re gonna put all of
these little beans over here

190
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:55,829
in our saucepan. Now we’re gonna take our
saucepan and head over to the stove!

191
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:59,930
Turn your heat to medium-low, leave the mixture
on the stove until it’s nice

192
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,839
and warm and begins to thicken. Making sure
not to burn.

193
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,329
Once it’s ready, remove from the stove and
take it back to your baking station.

194
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,100
I just took the pudding off the stove, be
careful, it’s really, really hot.

195
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,300
Now I’m gonna pour it through our strainer.
I’ve got a bowl here, strainer

196
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,379
on the top. Remember, it’s hot, just be
careful, watch your fingers!

197
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,539
And, we’re gonna add our butter.

198
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,759
Using the spatula, I’m gonna mix in the
butter until it’s completely melted and shiny.

199
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,709
I’m gonna let my pudding sit out at room
temperature for about 15-20 minutes,

200
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,029
and then I’m gonna cover the top with a
piece of plastic wrap, so that the

201
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:38,429
pudding won’t form a skin, and pop it in
the fridge to chill.

202
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:42,360
While our pudding is in the fridge, we are
gonna whip together our heavy whipping

203
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,619
cream and sugar, in this bowl right here.

204
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:50,079
Then using a hand mixer, I’m gonna mix together
on a lower speed, until it becomes

205
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,740
thicker, and then I’m gonna crank it up!
I’m gonna crank this up probably

206
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,649
to a 5!

207
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,550
Yum! Whipped cream, I’ll have a little bite!

208
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,899
I’ve let the pudding set, in the fridge
to chill for 2 hours and now we are ready

209
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:04,430
to assemble our cute little panda pudding
cups!

210
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,089
I’ve got my little cups laid out here, and
I’ve got the pudding, I’ve put it into

211
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,720
a plastic baggie, and cut off the end for
just a little bit more control.

212
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,290
And then over here in this bowl, I’ve just
crushed up some Oreos, you can throw

213
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,610
them in a blender, they’re all crushed up,
I left the filling in there.

214
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,619
And we’re just gonna start stacking.

215
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:24,980
It’s gonna go Oreos, pudding, Oreos, pudding.
We’re gonna layer it!

216
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,879
Time for my favorite part! It is time to decorate!

217
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,790
Take your little ice cream scoop, we’re
gonna go over here to our whipped cream,

218
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,649
take a scoop, and we’re really gonna pack
it in there.

219
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,329
And then, I’ve got a little hand towel over
here, and I’m just gonna tap it

220
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,409
onto the side of the counter, like this.

221
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,620
It’s a little bit messy, but it’s really
gonna give it a nice shape.

222
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:44,350
Here we go!

223
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,780
First one, we’re gonna flip it upside down,
oooop!!

224
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,339
We’re gonna pipe on simple panda faces using
our candy melts!

225
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,720
2 little ears, little nose, and 2 eyes.

226
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,309
Now we’re gonna do this to make the rest
of our Panda Pudding Cups!

227
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,629
Ta-da!

228
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,380
Here are all the DIY Panda Themed Treats that

229

00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:29,180
visit, please leave me a comment down below,
because I would love to see you guys.

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,399
I am so excited about this because, I
don’t get out of my house

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,679
very often, I just don’t travel a lot because
I’m always in my kitchen

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,969
making Nerdy Nummies.

11
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,280
This is gonna be the first opportunity that
I have to tour around and to meet so

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,870
many of you guys face to face, so it’s just
very special for me.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,949
And, this is pretty cool, we’re gonna be
on one of those huge, like

14
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,170
rockstar tour busses, it’s gonna have 6
beds.

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,069
We’re gonna board the bus in New York, on
the East Coast, and we’re gonna drive

16
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:01,260
throughout the country doing meet-ups and
then we’re gonna end in California!

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,040
If you haven’t pre-ordered your Nerdy Nummies 
cookbook yet, you can go to the website

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,260

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,910

23
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,270
Second announcement, I am gonna be going to
Stream Con this year, it is in

24
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,920
New York City, and, I’m gonna be there October
31st!

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,450
Which is Halloween, it’s my favorite holiday,
so it’s pretty special you guys!

26
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,980
I’m gonna be doing a panel, a book signing,
and just hanging out with you guys.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,800
So if you are in the area, you should swing
by and say hi!

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,780
Third announcement is that I teamed up with
Best Fiends!

29
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,700
You guys know that I love this game, I am
totally addicted, like….

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,980
I am currently on level 308. Ooooh!

31
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,200
If you guys play this game a lot, let me know
what level in the comments what level

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,829
you are on. The games are really short, so
I can play a few before I fall asleep.

33
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:21,219
And, I love all the little bug characters
that you unlock.

34
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,700
You guys know Howie’s my favorite! I gotta
show you this you guys, but, I've

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,790
leveled Howie to be level 15 and he looks
like a little Wizard now!

36
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,239
Hello Howie!

37
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,769
Best Fiends is doing something really fun,
they are doing a big Treasure Hunt!

38
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,420
The objective of this treasure hunt is to
find 13 stickers, hidden throughout

39
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,159
the game. This is really cool because the
stickers are inspired by myself and some

40
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,459
other YouTuber's Channels. So, one of the stickers
looks like a cupcake that

41
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,079
we made on Nerdy Nummies, it might be like
the cupcake we made with

42
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,439
Austin Mahone… Mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
But I don’t want to spoil it!

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,520
I can’t tell you exactly where to find my
sticker in the game.

45
00:03:03,529 --> 00:03:09,620
But I can say that Howie’s my favorite character,
he loves cupcakes and he has a

46
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,120
pretty cool back story you should maybe check
out….

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,620
A-ha-ha!

48
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:18,999
If you find all the stickers in the game you
get to open up a chest and what you

49
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:23,879
get inside are diamonds, gold, always comes
in handy, and a cute character named

50
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,519
Newt! I got him on my phone I’ll give you
a sneak peak, OK?

51
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,919
He’s a little frog, he’s super cute!

52
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,439
Random fact, I used to have a frog growing
up, his name was AquaDude, and I got

53
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,930
him because he was the class pet, and then during
Winter Break he needed a home,

54
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,669
someone to take care of him, so I brought
him home.

55
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:44,029
I was like, I’ll volunteer to take him home.
And then I fell in love with him and

56
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:45,489
the teacher let me keep him.

57
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,340
If you want to play the treasure hunt, it
is for a limited time, you can download

58
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,579
Best Fiends for free on iPad, iPhone or Android, I’ll
be putting some links down below!

59
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,309
The fourth announcement is about the Nerdy
Nummies Cookbook itself.

60
00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:03,400
I wanted to show you guys the final cover!
I worked with a designer to make

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,840
the new Nerdy Nummies Font! And I am so excited
because it’s starting to feel real!

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,279
We’re so close, it’s almost here, even
as we are speaking, the Nerdy Nummies

63
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:17,489
Cookbook is printing! I got some footage of
the printing process and I wanted to

64
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,609
show you guys so you could see it coming together!

65
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:24,810
I’m so excited for you guys to finally see
it! Ah! We’re so close!

66
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,789
Speaking of books, my fifth announcement is
for all you bookworms!

67
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,379
I have been reading a sci-fi series, it’s
a trilogy, but I’ve only read the

68
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:39,250
first one, it’s Red Rising by Pierce Brown.
It is so good that I had to share

69
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,319
it with you guys! If you like sci-fi and space,
I think you’ll really like this,

70
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,879
this one’s set on Mars.

71
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:49,690
I am gonna be on a tour bus for about a month,
so if you guys have any good book

72
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,849
suggestions, please let me know down below.
I think I’m gonna have a lot of time

73
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,669
to catch up on some reading, so if you are
reading any really good book series,

74
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,930
I would love to know about them so I can check
them out.

75
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,479
Please leave me a comment down below and I
will definitely check it out.

76
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,090
Alright, that does it for announcements, I
am so excited for everything!

77
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,930
I hope to see you at Stream Con and I will
be making another update video

78
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,460
as soon as I get tour dates and locations.

79
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,280
OK, bye-bye!

80
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,080

So video ""games"" have been annoying me lately. Not so much overwatch or watchdogs but mobile games that have zero gameplay involved. I don't want you to hack my game so it plays itself.

what is a game I just downloaded a game

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,990

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,240
is that the game pls itself what's

13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,219

crap games developers I have a great

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,280
idea

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,260
don't make garbage just because there's

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,640
one popular game area tap twinkies and

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,050
it makes Twinkies doesn't mean you

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,610
should make a game to tap ring-dings

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,170
like they're vomiting pretty colors on

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,930
the screen telling me to tap and calling

24
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,370
it a game that's not a game okay and yet

25
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,559
it is there's a whole genre of these

26
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,300
ridiculous clicker games coming out and

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,949
no one is saying anything to stop them

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,539
well the entire world is relying on one

29
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,520
bald cartoon character to tell them

30
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,559
their games are stupid that's exactly

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,210
what I have to do they're stupid and if

32
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,100

they get tricked into playing these

37
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,479
games

38
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,760
well I explain it to you right now this

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,860
is the dumb dumbs guide to not playing

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,500
games that are not games fling number

41
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,180
one best fiends forever definitely the

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,220
best example of everything I hate in a

43
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,350
game you literally just tap the screen

44
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,000
endlessly and little animals get pissy

45
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,409
until they disappear how do they come up

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,750
with this stuff somebody go to an

47
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,659
aquarium tap on the glass and go oh this

48
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,189
this I could do for I hate this game

49
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,119
because I play it the only thing I like

50
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,500
is that they're honest in their

51
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,180
marketing I mean right on their website

52
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,650
it says recommend it to someone you

53
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,180
don't like well it worked because I

54
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,920
played your game and now I don't like

55
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,140
myself I look at the word game in the

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,090
dictionary that's a form of play decided

57
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,740
by skill strength or luck this does none

58
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,780
of those things so yeah people love it

59
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,270
it's got 4.5 stars in the App Store and

60
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,320
yet it requires you to do nothing

61
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,520
nothing I actually read an official

62
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,320

96
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,150
pay more money so it plays with itself

this video I'm going to bring you a

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,810
sponsored message on behalf of the game

4
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,429
best fiends for ever now the developers

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,019
did not specify whether or not we could

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,670
have a fireworks battle while delivering

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,170
a sponsored message so I will be

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,639
attempting to play the game while not

9
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,100

12
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,289
fiends trilogy and I would describe best

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,080
fiends forever as an addictive clicker

14
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,150
game which means that you get more

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,500
damage and more money the faster you tap

16
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,269
your screen making each level a little

17
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,489
more satisfying than the last

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,079
now you collect a bunch of stuff there's

19
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:37,320

20
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,430
the game anyways I will now attempt to

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:01:02,340
play the game while defending my

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:01:04,680
fireworks Kingdom alright anyway smell

22

this level Oh crushes a brief but

23
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,940
intense infatuation for someone

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,260
especially someone unattainable or

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,149
inappropriate wait what what do you mean

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,980
unattainable

27
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,860
what do you mean inappropriate okay so

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,020
let's not listen to that and just say

29
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,360
crushes equals having a strong liking

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,979
towards another individual if you like

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,040
someone you usually end up doing the

32
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,750
following things you stare off in the

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,729
blank void of eternity thinking about

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,590
him or her that you end up in really

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,909
awkward situations where you're staring

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,490
at a random person for no apparent

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,409
reason whatsoever you get really bad

38
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,970
butterflies in your stomach just talking

39
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,409
to them which kind of feels like a

40
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,470
slight stomachache now that I think

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,180
about it you anticipate seeing them

42
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,460
throughout the day mainly being the

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,110
highlight of your day to begin would you

44
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,970
fear rejection how hard so let me tell

45
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,130
you about my high school crush when I

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,110
was in high school I would draw non-stop

47
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,090
and by the end of the class bunch of my

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,659
classmates would watch me draw they were

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,000
fascinated by my drawings except one guy

50
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,479
he would just walk away as if I didn't

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,430
exist

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,670
oh so that's what you meant about

53
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,320
unattainable well then anyways let's

54
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,689
call this guy George

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,130
we were Facebook friends somehow and we

56
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,069
ended up talking to each other at one

57
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,190
point he posted a status I decided to be

58
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,290
witty and he messaged me so eventually

59
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,770
after talking for a while we ended up

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,510
hanging

61
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,940
out of the beach with my friends Coney

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,920
Island has this ferris wheel and George

63
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,530
decided he wanted to go on the ride

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,330
none of my friends wanted to go so me

65
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,210
trying to impress a heck out of this guy

66
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,860
said all right let's go but by the way

67
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,080
you should know I'm terrified of heights

68
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,910
put me on the second floor terrace and

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,280
I'll be holding on the railings for my

70
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:38,280
dear life but this time I was thinking

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,600
over you avoid wait this is it it's

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,200
going to be a super cute and romantic

73
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,580
variable right and oh my name this is it

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,870
this is perfect

75
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,300
we're going to get on the top of the

76
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,490
ferris wheel is gonna be so cute

77
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,670
so we got our tickets and we're about to

78
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,150
get online one lane said stationary has

79
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,610
other side swinging George Oh George

80
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,070
went on the swinging line and called me

81
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,070
a big baby when I said stationary so I

82
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,900
had no choice I know big baby we got on

83
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,090
the swinging cart and it wasn't that bad

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,290
it was rocking back and forth a little

85
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,210
maybe maybe I was overthinking it no we

86
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,190
got on the top and instead of a cute let

87
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,330
me tell you how much I liked a moment we

88
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,209
were song all the way to the moon him

89
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,490
back stationary would move in the normal

90
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,620
ferris wheel way swinging wouldn't move

91
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,060
the same way plus throwing you back and

92
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,830
forth feeling like you're about to drop

93
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,800
into the parking lot and face flat

94
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,200
before I held on for my dear life well

95
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,670
George tried to tickle me because he

96
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,520
thought it was funny I legitimately

97
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,530
thought I was going to die but you don't

98
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,560
know that because I tend smile and laugh

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,540
when I'm nervous or panicking I'm just

100
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,030
kind of happy then in puke or pee myself

101
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,680
in the process I'm pretty proud of that

102
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,410
I might have teared up a little though

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,240
like seriously

104
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,490
after going through hell and back he

105
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,730
eventually told me he liked me and I

106
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:01,140
told him I liked him Mac hope you guys

107
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,390

95,NINJA WEAPONS VS SODA!!,Ukrfw8-SYSY,"WE EXPLODED SODA WITH AWESOME NINJA WEAPONS! CHECK OUT THIS AWESOME VLOG! Thanks to Best Fiends for sponsoring! Download the game for FREE here: http://download.BestFiends.com/BiggestEver 

Today Stephen Sharer, his brother Carter Sharer, and Lizzy Sharer went to visit their close friend Chad Wild Clay in California. Chad and Vy greeted the Sharers when they arrived. Chad then showed the Sharer around the house and even showed them his huge collection of Ninja weapons. Stephen, Carter, and Liz all picked an epic Ninja weapon and went outside. First Chad set up a water balloon and attacked it with nunchucks. The water balloon exploded blue water everywhere it was so cool. Next Liz used the crescent moon Ninja sword against a pumpkin. She swung the Ninja sword and easily sliced the pumpkin in half. Then Stephen was up next with his giant Nina sword. This sword is giant, and is about 6ft long. He swung the huge sword at a pumpkin and sliced into it half way. Then Carter was up next with his rainbow colored Ninja sword vs soda. Carter got into position and on the count of three he attacked the soda bottle. He stabbed the soda bottle and when the sword pierced the bottle it exploded fruit punch everywhere. Vy then finished up the Ninja weapons with an epic Halo energy sword vs a mini hydro dipped pumpkin. She easily sliced the pumpkin in half. Todays vlog was super fun and it was awesome to hang out with Chad Wild Clay and Vy. Comment #Ninja and what Ninja weapon was your favorite.

what would Justin Bieber do exactly I

193
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,370
know I saw this next technique on the

194
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,500
Internet what apparently you take rubber

195
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,810
bands and you wrap them around the eggs

196
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,630
and then you put them in like a die of

197
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,410
some sort

198
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,120

200
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,290

without further ado let's get on with

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,430
the video

24
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:12,619
let's go cuz hard is hard to predict

25
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,930
you're shittin me

26
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,119
so try listening to some music when you

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,890
study specifically research has shown

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,500
that mirtha plane during your study

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,970
improves your memory and concentration

30
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,160
this obviously doesn't apply to all

31
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,290
forms of music like heavy metal but

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:34,670
classical or ambient sounds played at

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:36,350
low volume do help caffeine has been

34
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,960
shown to improve your concentration and

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,790
focus so try having some coffee next

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,100
time you're studying and see how you go

37
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,200
some people can't handle coffee as well

38
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,210
as others so just test it with a small

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,579
amount first you can also try other

40
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,170
things like tea chocolate or energy

41
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:54,920
drinks as they also contain smaller

42
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,790
amounts of caffeine and you make me one

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,860
this film is no your life is just begun

44
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,140
when you're studying make sure to take

45
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,119
study breaks research was actually shown

46
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,799
it's best to study in 30-minute blocks

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,899
and then take five-minute breaks in

48
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,910
between each block so you can reward

49
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,400
yourself with whatever you like whether

50
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,709
it's a YouTube video or a snack or even

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,690
a short game I've personally been

52
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,190
playing best fiends lately and it's the

53
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,930
perfect game to play during breaks

54
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,420
because you can finish each stage in

55
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,010
only a few minutes it's basically a

56
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,720
puzzle adventure game where you can

57
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,670
collect and build a team of fiends to

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,470
defeat plugs by matching same colored

59
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:39,720
objects

60
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:41,880
[Music]

61
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,830
this month best fiends is having the

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,050
biggest update ever adding over a

63
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,790
hundred and fifty levels you can

64
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,380
download the game for free and if you

65
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,450
download using my link below you'll get

66
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,340
an extra five dollars worth of goals and

67
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,160
diamonds to use for free in the games

68
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,890
you can turn that down I'm currently on

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,120
level 262 so see if you can beat me

70
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,730
lactose

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:09,150
oh thanks through this so tell my father

72
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:10,680
shader plans no I see I see myself so

73
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,430
you know how teachers never let you chew

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,070
gum in class

75
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,900
well apparently chewing gum may actually

76
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,000
improve your memory and help you focus

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,280
when you study research has shown that

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,170
chewing gum increases the oxygen flow to

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,660
your brain and therefore improves

80
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,370
concentration and alertness so you still

81
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,380
probably won't be allowed during class

82
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,780
but you can try chewing some gum next

83
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:37,980
time you study at home

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:40,500
oh just a great trick to help you

85
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,840
remember things is to use a mnemonic for

86
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,870
example you can use PEMDAS to remember

87
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,530
the order of operations remember it by

88
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,569
saying please excuse my dear Aunt Sally

89
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,489
it actually stands for parentheses

90
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,940
exponents multiplication division

91
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,319
addition and subtraction you obviously

92
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,150
weren't having a monic to help you

93
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,370
remember everything but when it's

94
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,350
available definitely try to make use of

95
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,810
it because it'll make remembering that

96
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,700
particular thing is so much easier and

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,709
if you're feeling creative you can make

98
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,430
up your own and share with others in the

99
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,430
comment section

100
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,910
if you read your books in silence you're

101
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,680
more likely to read passively have you

102
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,270
ever read a textbook only to realize

103
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,360
that you've completely forgotten what

104
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,400
the last page said yep that happens to

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,470
me a lot but if you read out loud you're

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
reading actively this forces your brain

107
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,060
to process what you're reading and also

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,310
helps you remember it better later

109
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,340
unicorns are a mythical creature that do

110
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:48,190
not have wings the ones that have wings

111
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,200
are called Pegasus if you're getting

112
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,750
bored of reading your text books you can

113
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,910
try watching some courses online they're

114
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,710
actually heaps of free video lessons on

115
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,200
YouTube that cover a huge range of

116
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,420
topics channels like crash course offer

117
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,640
courses of various subjects and also

118
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,110
puts them into playlists so it's easier

119
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,450
to browse the topic you need help with

120
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,000
personally I can't sit still and read a

121
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,710
textbook for hours on end and I much

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,580
prefer learning through video lessons

123
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:20,830
because it just feels more interactive

124
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,930
you barely got me stuck try using a

125
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,789
recording device to record your lessons

126
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,979
you can probably just use your phone for

127
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:28,750
this this way you'll then be able to

128
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,550
review the lesson anytime you need to

129
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,710
jog your memory the best thing about

130
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,169
this is you can save time by listening

131
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,849
to it at double speed the best time to

132
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,680
review the lesson is actually on the

133
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,419
same day as studies have shown that

134
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,740
doing this improves your memory of the

135
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:43,740
lesson five sixty percent

136
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,530
do you know what I see I see myself

137
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,150
trying to read a large block of text can

138
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,920
get boring and it makes it harder to

139
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,430
concentrate and memorize what you're

140
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,430
reading

141
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,800
so instead add some colors and diagrams

142
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,600
to your notes this just helps your brain

143
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,150
organize the information better and

144
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,860
stops it from going on autopilot I mean

145
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,570
you don't need to make the diagram super

146
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,940
pretty already being just having them

147
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,690
there at all is enough

148
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:18,240
[Music]

149
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,220
sleeping is a study hack sign me up

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,020
but seriously you need to get a good

151
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,759
night's sleep when you're studying the

152
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,410
brain organizes your memories whilst

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,060
you're asleep so if you don't get enough

154
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,220
sleep you'll forget more of what you let

155
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,289
the previous save so make sure you're

156
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:39,509
getting enough sleep don't need to tell

157
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:41,880
me twice this is gonna sound a bit

158
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:44,400
strange but try putting on some perfume

159
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,320
whenever you study the right people you

160
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,120
need to take your test just spray a bit

161
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,520
of the same perfume and then go ahead

162
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,320
and take your test the reason this works

163
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,690
is because smell is actually a really

164
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,550
strong memory trigger for your brace so

165
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,760
by using the same perfume you'll be able

166
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,740
to record what you studied much easier

167
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,750
[Music]

168
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,180
you know

169
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,950
when you study it's ten times more

170
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,080
effective to write notes rather than

171
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,450
just read your textbook even if you

172
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,100
never look at these notes ever again the

173
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,260
act of writing them alone helps you

174
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,970
memorize the information and no

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,160
highlighting and underlining your

176
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:31,580
textbook and not as effective as writing

177
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:33,350
out notes one of the best ways to help

178
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,000
you remember what you're studying is to

179
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,340
actually teach it to one of your friends

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,530
doing this forces you to understand the

181
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,540
topic much better and therefore you

182
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,910
remember more when it comes to exam time

183
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,710
also you'll earn brownie points from

184
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:51,080
your friend which can also come in handy

185
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:54,160
later maybe in the form of brownie where

186
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,090
you can be good you'll get what you do

187
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,700
if you having trouble with math problems

188
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:00,200
you can use your phone to help you you

189
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,790
can actually get apps where you take a

190
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,919
picture of a math problem and the app

191
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,900
will not only give you the solution but

192
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,120
will also show you the working out

193
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,980
process that way you can learn how it's

194
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,840
done so the next time you come across a

195
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,419
similar problem you'll be able to work

196
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,419
it out yourself and guys when I saw this

197
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,980
happen it literally blew my mind it's so

198
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,009
cool

try bear in your study location study at

201
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,720
the same desk at the same time every day

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,710
can get pretty boring and uninspiring

203
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,630
studies have shown that you retain

204
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,070
information better when you bury your

205
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,930
study location because the new

206
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,630
surroundings automatically makes your

207
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:41,940
brain more alert you can try a park a

208
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:46,140
quiet cafe or a local library to mix

209
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,959
things up a bit the left is all thanks

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,550
with some online quizzes these are great

212
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,930
to practice with before your actual exam

213
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,209
just to make sure you're on the right

colon edu followed by your subject and

217
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,630
then exam for example if you want to

218
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,120
test yourself on biology you'd write

219
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,120
site call an edu biology exam

220
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,960
you barely got me stuck

221
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,640
try making a study group study groups

222
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,010
help you memorize information better

223
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,900
because of a few things firstly by

224
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,000
talking and asking questions you're

225
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,670
actively memorizing and organizing

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,080
information most likely you'll also be

227
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,210
teaching your friends at some point

228
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,890
which helps and also they help to keep

229
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,780
you accountable to make sure you don't

230
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,890
slack off just make sure you guys stay

231
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:43,620
on track and don't get too distracted

232
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:45,750
one for the left it's all thanks to this

233
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,430
shorter there are certain foods that are

234
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,350
known to improve your memory so

235
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,580
definitely try increasing your intake of

236
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,020
these foods when you're studying for

237
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,830
exams avocados blueberries broccoli

238
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:02,630

00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,470
a walk during your study breaks again

242
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,270
studies have shown that being outside

243
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,520
improves your brain function and memory

244
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,440
so don't lock yourself indoors all day

250
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,790
quiz yourself on topics you've already

251
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,650
studied and instead of actually carrying

252
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,960
around a bunch of flashcards you can

253
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,670
just use an app on your phone there are

254
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,710
tons of apps available where you can

255
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,680
make your earn Handy flashcards and test

256
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,060
yourself anywhere anytime it's super

257
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,430
convenient when you're sitting on the

258
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,210
bus or train and you won't accidentally

259
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:05,769
misplace or lose them

261
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,300
lastly don't compare yourself to other

262
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:13,129
people you might see these students who

263
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,259
seem to be naturally gifted and get high

264
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:16,819
marks without doing much work at all but

265
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,069
don't let that affects how you study

266
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,509
Marx's schools don't necessarily mean a

267
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:22,399
lot in the real world and I can

268
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,850
definitely tell you that hard work beats

269
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,499

anyway is just your ex here's a little

47
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,360
clip of me at playing the game

48
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,950
explaining what it's all about alright

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,890
so I've been playing for a while some up

50
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,140
to level 9 and basically you're just

51
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,660
trying to connect the dots this is kind

52
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,510
of like a little pregame workout right

53
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,150
now and you want to match them up and

54
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,400
get as many of these same symbols

55
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:35,750
together because you're trying to defeat

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,490
that bad guy so here we go oh we're just

57
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,930
gone to the King care no more actually

58
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,660
sorry that wasn't a free game just

59
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,820
actually the real real game and it has

60
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,950
to be a minimum three things but this

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,510
game was so addicting and like I feel

62
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,180
like it's perfect if you need like a

63
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,519
distraction like when I go on flights it

64
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,000
just like keeps me distracted from being

65
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,190
afraid of flying so it's really good

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,500
your ever anxious because it just

67
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:03,830
focuses your mind on this oh I think I'm

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,450
stuck no no that works and you have a

69
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,290
certain amount of moves that you have to

70
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,150
do this under or LT leads and so far I

71
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,290
have it locked at all or it could have

72
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,700

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,379
now we're going to take these down and

160
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,919
put them in the microwave for about two

161
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,750
minutes

162
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,430
and I think that's what would you ought

163
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,129
to look at the directions again but I

164
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,250
need to learn how to read yeah okay oh

165
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:13,710
me down there oh right so we have a

166
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,539
rainbow in the damn microwave huh

167
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,060
oh it's goopy that's good

168
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:23,610
movable in okay so what we're gonna do

169
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,610
is we're gonna pop these in for two

170
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:29,490
minutes and then uh supposed to make it

171
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,469
more liquidy and then as it cools after

172
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,800
it's done microwaving it starts to

173
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,510
solidify okay okay okay this just in I

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,700
read the directions again and apparently

175
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,339
it's supposed to boil like you're

176
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,169
supposed to boil the slime and one that

177
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:44,219
happening then you stir it and then you

178
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,290
put it in for another minute

179
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,480
so we're gonna see it still has another

180
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,209
four to five seconds if they are boiling

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,680
I think there's a lot in there I think

182
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,880
it's gonna take more than two minutes

183
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,490
TBH but we'll find out okay so it's been

184
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,260
in there for like five minutes total so

185
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,769
I'm just gonna give it a oh my god super

186
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:08,850
liquidy now I'm gonna tree stir and take

187
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,660

188
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,210

189
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,680

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:19,160
oh my god look is it really good oh wow

191
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,600
it's seaming it yeah I think it does

192
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,170
that when I go in the microwave for five

193
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,780
minutes

194
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:30,290
sweet lot it's what all righty so these

195
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:33,530
are the cooled off versions of the

196
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,840
kool-aid bags and they're gooey Makua

197
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:39,110
stand but I feel like the purple is too

198
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,270
dark to make it into the final cut we

199
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,100
appoint and the yellow I don't think we

200
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,940
added enough men to me so because so

201
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:51,080
liquidy so we're not gonna add that in

202
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:54,800
unfortunately so let's get to eating and

203
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:58,070

here honey

45
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,729
hello Zoe was five years ago now it was

46
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,890
2012 I had been doing YouTube for two

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,049
years but I had just started to get like

48
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,470
an audience and a following I feel like

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,020
I may have had like 40 or 50,000

50
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,750
subscribers so I did have you know loyal

51
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,820
viewers and like fans of stuff and there

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,189
was this girl I'm not going to say her

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,750
name just because for privacy sakes we

54
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,310
haven't spoken in years so I don't want

55
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,649
to throw any mother but let's make up a

56
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,280
name Oliver would her name be let's use

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,530
the name Felicity so

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,300
the city was a fan of mine she watched

59
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,040
my videos you know she would comment on

60
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,750
them she would tweet to me and stuff and

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,640
I started to notice her tweets because

62
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,380
they were started consistent so

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,390
eventually I followed her back on

64
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,380
Twitter and then somehow we started

65
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,270
talking over the m's

66
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,890
and then we just started to talk kind of

67
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,140
casually for like a week over the end

68
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,150
and then somehow I forgot who sent who's

69
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,830
number first but somehow numbers were

70
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,360
exchanged and then we started texting

71
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,860
then we start like skyping and like I

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,420
chat again it's like video chatting

73
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,220
itself and we started to get to really

74
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,830
know each other and this was during a

75
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,750
time in my life that was pretty dark not

76
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:49,000
to like bring the mood down but I was in

77
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,950
college hating everything about college

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,780
hated my major did not know what I

79
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,090
wanted to do is my future I didn't like

80
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,040
the plan that I had set for me very

81
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,540
lonely it was one of the worst times of

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,239
my life like when I was in college and

83
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,130
alone I just wasn't that happy my only

84
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,330
happy point was like YouTube and stuff

85
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,400
though with my outlet but keep this in

86
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,430
mind I think I really liked the idea of

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,980
having someone to talk to and I just

88
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,440
like the idea of dating someone like in

89
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,840
my mind I wanted that because I knew I

90
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,090
would have someone and not feel so alone

91
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,070
but like looking back in a situation I

92
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,590
now realize that I'm going to have real

93
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,630
feelings for her so we talked for a

94
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,400
while maybe about him maybe not two

95
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,660
months we would do with texts and Skype

96
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,280
and stuff and got to know each other

97
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,590
really well and she was very nice very

98
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,489
cool Oliver just started but in return

99
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,530
her that far imma give you apart he like

100
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,070

101
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,070

103
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,570
Oliver her leave me alone and she lives

104
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,220
across the country we did not live in

105
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,470
the same area so we have not we had not

106
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,340
met in person and so we were like we

107
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,079
should make plans to like meet up so I

108
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,400
this part is crazy to me like looking

109
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:06,160

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,190
you sure I literally made plan I booked

111
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,590
plane tickets to fly to her house and

112
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,870
stay with her we were not dating yet we

113
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:19,150
had not met before

114
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:24,360
what bark if you agree that you should

115
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,360
sums up this video who is that

116
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:30,680
yes okay so I flew to Felicity's house I

117
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,540
say for about a week and like I will

118
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,830
admit started out kind of fun like we

119
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,990
did have a lot of things in common so

120
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,120
like the first like maybe like day or

121
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,330
two was pretty fun like we went we went

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,990
to places and like hung out but then but

123
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,090
then it started to change things started

124
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:50,090
to get a little awkward and that's

125
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,190
really awkward so before I move on just

126
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:54,440
keep in mind me being me and like

127
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,030
knowing who I am now looking back I know

128
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,650
that I did not have an attraction for

129
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,990
her I just can't help that fans got

130
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,640
really awkward for several reasons there

131
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,770
was one night we were in like this like

132
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:08,090
basement it was just me and her and what

133
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,460
you were never like this are you like

134
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,980
trying to play off your your character

135
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,780
on camera what is my on and I was just

136
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,280
trying to enjoy the movie you know it

137
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,540
was like paying attention and enjoying

138
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,940
it and she you know what it just makes

139
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,380
it was a little spicy up in here she

140
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,570
want to spice things up a bit

141
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,070
imagine me is like a guacamole but it

142
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,320
was like two mile like she wanted to add

143
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,720
some spice to that guacamole she threw

144
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,240
in a jalapeno pepper but it was rejected

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,100
basically we're sitting there and she

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,690
comes closer this likeness is

147
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,620
embarrassing this is why I haven't told

148
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,300
this story before because it's

149
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,310
embarrassing don't judge me it's fine

150
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,350
excuse me this is my one-of-a-kind

151
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,870
subscribe hello you're not gonna chew on

152
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,550
that she comes closer to me and puts her

153
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,770
arm around me but she's like fine like

154
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:55,040
whatever I can take that then she starts

155
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,640
putting her arm in like awkward and

156
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,200
inappropriate at ish places but places

157
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,900
like a couple would do which is like

158
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,880
normal for a couple but I was me you

159
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,230
know like she put her arm on my leg and

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,180
kind of like moved it up a little bit

161
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,670
and then like laid her head on my

162
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,880
shoulder like this except like right

163
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:20,240
here and I wasn't feeling it when she

164
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:22,430
did that I was just like what I'm gonna

165
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,170
be nice Lecter like motions and actions

166
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,300
can speak louder than words because not

167
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,300
many words were exchanged in this moment

168
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,699
you know what I'm getting pretty tired

169
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,669
but it's 11 o'clock which is passing

170
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,630
bedtime so I'm going to hit pay if

171
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:54,070
that's okay

172
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,660
put that right good night oh and that

173
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,580
was you're like one little instance like

174
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,500
the whole trip was kind of like that it

175
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,120
would be like moments where she tried to

176
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,220
like make a move and I didn't feel

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,229
comfortable and okay with that I would

178
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,639
like awkward ly get my way out of it I

179
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:08,169
remember one night we took a walk down

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,880
her street and it was like really fun

181
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,830
and cute and stuff and then like she

182
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,229
wanted me to kiss her I think she

183
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,729
Liberty told me to kiss her looking back

184
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,560
honestly I kind of feel bad for her

185
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:20,169
because she likes this guy and thought

186
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,000
that he liked her back and you know

187
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:23,770
expected like kissing and stuff and he

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,820
wouldn't do it so like she wanted a kiss

189
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,090
and what had happened

190
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:32,410
so she Liddy had to ask him me to kiss

191
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:35,320
her I said like I'm I am to blame here

192
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,639
like bless her but whatever here's what

193
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:42,190
here's what happened we took a loss and

194
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:48,340
this is how it ended such a nice night

195
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:50,950
Felicity why don't you say Wow Ricky

196
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,570
it's such a beautiful night is there

197
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,150
anything you want to do huh

198
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,190
what do you mean well I've been waiting

199
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,460
for a kiss all week and I select this

200
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,500
beautiful night is the perfect chance

201
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:07,750
why don't you kiss me I think I'm

202
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:13,060
getting like a cold all so I don't want

203
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,419
to get you sick too much let's go back

204
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,419
to your house

205
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,320
okay basically it was like stuff like

206
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,630
that over and over again all week we

207
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,740
would have a fun moment and like friends

208
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,540
hanging out but it would have really

209
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,700
awkward moments like that where things

210
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,800
got like couple E and like lovey-dovey

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,479
and I never felt I didn't know what to

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,550
do if I would like to work my way out of

213
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,330
them and she just wanted to happen and

214
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,650
again looking back wow I really suck all

215
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,330
right Oliver you're really cute but

216
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,190
you're distracting me so I'm gonna put

217
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:54,690
you down and let you go play say goodbye

218
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:57,300
to them mommy the morning I was supposed

219
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,640
to leave is when things like hit the

220
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,440
ceiling fan again we weren't official we

221
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,380
weren't dating and in my mind I was like

222
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,420
I don't want this she's cool she's fun

223
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,370
but like I don't want to date her so I'm

224
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,770
just gonna go home and like move on with

225
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,570
my life but I'm guessing in her mind she

226
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,270
really liked me and wanted things to be

227
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,610
like official so I remember this like

228
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,590
vividly the morning I woke up to

229
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,200
literally fly on the day I was leaving

230
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,620
she text me or she was like so this week

231
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,950
was great are you gonna ask me out to be

232
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,340
your girlfriend I think the signs had

233
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,410
been everywhere like you know I'm ready

234
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,410
free to ask me and it was really like

235
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,060
over text we were like - recomment a

236
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,250
guest room and she was next to me like

237
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,970
over text and it was awkward and I was I

238
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,760
read that Jax and I was just like and

239
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,460
like nowadays I know who I am confident

240
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,370
with my him I don't do things that are

241
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,810
wrong or whatever so like this happened

242
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,120
to me like today I would be like look

243
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:59,490
I'm sorry I don't feel this way I don't

244
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,230
have these feelings but and then when

245
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,560
you tell her straight up but me way back

246
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,630
then was so insecure I was not sure

247
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,580
about myself who I was and nothing made

248
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,560
sense to me now which is fairies again

249
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,150
like in a dark place in my mi life and

250
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,800
didn't know what was going on and I

251
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,080
wanted someone I just wanted like I

252
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,330
wanted like someone you know that was

253
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,030
lonely so in a sense I just felt

254
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,300
pressured to ask her I didn't want to

255
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,130
say no and like risk her freaking out

256
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,370
and like leaving me because I had this

257
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,680
person I was talking

258
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,760
there's like this making of a mini fence

259
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,460
this is why I haven't told store before

260
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:38,800
for this so hard explain so I replied to

261
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:42,400
her text I was like yeah sure would you

262
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,390
be my girlfriend which one would you be

263
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,040
my girlfriend

264
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,020
and she said yes and I went to the

265
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,140
airport and flew home said a Knopf very

266
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,610
awkward goodbye dodged another kiss got

267
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,460
back home and then this is when things

268
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,350
got really bad I will say now I really

269
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,930
tried to make it work and like try to

270
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,550
like make feelings happen you know even

271
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,860
though they weren't there but for some

272
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,550
reason she became a different person

273
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,500
it's like we were talking she like a fun

274
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,450
slightly flirtatious friend but that

275
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,740
wasn't became like official she like

276
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,420
went crazy

277
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:18,610
she became so controlling and one of the

278
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,040
top twenty four/seven and it drove me

279
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,270
insane like she literally would get so

280
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,250
mad at me

281
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,900
when I would have to go film videos

282
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,000
because like I you know I put my phone

283
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,280
down a night film and I edit and it

284
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,020
takes a long time I get takes hours and

285
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,120
hours and hours so I wouldn't you know

286
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,280
miss texts or be really late to text and

287
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,290
she would get so mad at me because I was

288
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,880
making a video and like okay this is a

289
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,130
pet peeve of mine whether it's about

290
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,690
just me or about anyone when you're

291
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,300
dating someone I feel like you should

292
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:47,620
always support and be cool with whatever

293
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,080
they're passionate about or whatever

294
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,030
like their career is I get someone wants

295
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,010
to be a youtuber and is making videos or

296
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,210
they want to be a singer or a dancer or

297
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,280
they're going to be a doctor and they're

298
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,810
studying for an exam or whatever the

299
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,220
case may be if they're really pushing or

300
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,000
we can cover something you should

301
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,330
support that

302
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,510
don't ever get mad at them for working

303
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:09,430
hard and having goals for it I feel like

304
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,530
it went on for a month which looking

305
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,420
back like I'm sighs suck because I

306
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,700
literally I led her on

307
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,560
I did not have real feelings at the time

308
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,820
I did not know that I genuinely didn't

309
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,130
know that but looking back I did not

310
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,400
have real feelings and so I was leading

311
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,680
her on

312
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,470
but finally I realized that and I was

313
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,630
like wow you know I don't like her I

314
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,790
like the idea of having someone but I

315
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,950
don't like Felicity maybe I shouldn't be

316
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,290
doing that so I broke up with her and

317
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,120
was hoping things would be okay

318
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,440
just you know we can be friends still

319
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,949
you're fun to talk to

320
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:47,709
I'll touch you tomorrow but she freaked

321
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:50,680
out like she was mad she blew up blew up

322
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,829
on me I was like terrified but I tried

323
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,440
to move on but unfortunately she was

324
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,480
still bitter and salty about it so she

325
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,130
said something that wasn't really cool

326
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,509
all right and this next part is the

327
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,100
reason why I wanted to tell the story

328
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,769
because I wanted to make an impact in

329
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,529
push an important message here so after

330
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:12,850
we broke up I moved on tried to get back

331
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:14,920
to my normal life she was mad and she

332
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,810
started to tell other people that the

333
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,940
reason why we broke up was because I was

334
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,949
gay like I Liddy had my friends texting

335
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,779
me asking me if I was gay because they

336
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,300
found out we broke up because I was gay

337
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:28,449
now whether or not I was gay whatever

338
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,240
the case it's so wrong to do that if

339
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:33,550
someone is unsure themself and leichter

340
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,079
they might be in the closet or whatever

341
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,670
the case may be if they haven't come out

342
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,760
yet and I'm not sure about what's going

343
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,680
on it's so wrong to assume someone's

344
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,500
sexuality and go around telling people

345
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,149
it especially because they broke up it's

346
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,670
not your place to out someone

347
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:51,279
fortunately I have figured out who I am

348
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,899
but back then you know I wasn't sure I

349
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,220
was figuring things out you know when

350
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,380
this happened it freaked me out because

351
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,360
all of a sudden I was labeled and

352
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,680
pinpointed there was any text that I was

353
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,529
like it's not her place to try and out

354
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:08,350
me so I want to use that and go into a

355
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:10,510
bigger broader message any of you

356
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,060
watching I want you all to know that you

357
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:15,850
should never one assume someone

358
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,470
sexuality and two out someone don't

359
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,510
assume someone is something and then

360
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,180
tell people that because they might not

361
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,949
be - if you actually do know someone

362
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,250
sexuality but they're not out yet don't

363
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:29,980
tell people it's not your place it's not

364
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,689

fan game the only reason I'm playing

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,269
this one is because supposedly it's

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,830
funny and I really really enjoy the

8
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,900
humorous takes on five minutes of Freddy

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:26,580
and I'm pretty sure dabbing it is that

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,609

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,890

13
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,390
nights of this ah I'm just gonna play it

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,450
until it stops being funny because I

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,450
really really liked all the funny

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,260
five nights at Freddy's fair hmm fuck

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,399
you buddy

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,110
5 9 f NBF boiler blow ha ha I killed

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,899
your kid in my last game caught a bum

20
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,300
boot go down to fazbear's adverts to do

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,730
oh boy will I be responsible for all

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,680
injury and just remember at school I

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,270
play very simple observed 39 on the

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,840
cameras for trophies or listen for his

25
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,760
movement

26
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,530
always check the doors in Casey's there

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,610
and his movement is completely random it

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,049
would come into the office and drain

29
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,280
power and you'll be temporarily stunned

30
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,880
when he enters you must click on his

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,560
nose and make him believe ah

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,460

what it's so what if I killed your son I

253
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,470
mean that's what we exist animatronics

254
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:15,319
do because for some reason when children

255
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,860
are murdered and they're put into

256
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:20,189
animatronics suits they've become

257
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:25,079
murderers it makes so much sense doesn't

258
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:26,970
it oh yeah okay I literally could not

259
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,100
think of anything else to say I'm going

260
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,269
to be more active as always I really

261
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,499
should stop telling you that every night

262
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:38,069
because you're basically not a drill

263
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:40,860

here for that's what I've been trying

404
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,820
this whole time man been trying right

405
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:13,320
realize I know you've been trying real

406
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,820
hard but listen not about bad yeah I'm

407
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,770
pretty sure this is set up for failure

408
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,480
I'm pretty sure the only way to get

409
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,200
through this is to lose all your power

410
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,510
and die because you walked in on a messy

411
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,490
masturbating Noorani brillo hmm no shot

412
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,050
for him but he delay so I think it's

413
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,360
gonna end and then when he kills me

414
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:35,670
there's gonna be something good at the

415
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:38,130
end oh maybe maybe be so much better but

416
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,870
you have to go with someone else hmm

417
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,790
now I don't know what that means things

418
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,890
could have been so much better but you

419
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,410
have to go with someone else me me have

420
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,610
to go or you she had to go with someone

421
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,790
else I couldn't quite understand you

422
00:21:47,610 --> 00:22:08,670
lift bra I I lifted your nose off of

423
00:21:50,790 --> 00:22:11,280
your super face yeah it's not good if

424
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:18,630
you're expecting the toreador March well

425
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:20,460
you got another thing coming okay I

426
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,660
don't think there's any way to win that

427
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,070
because I just don't think there's

428
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,390
enough power left it could be like a

429
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,640
random thing where you just like

430
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,620
randomly maybe win that but I think it's

431
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,910
worth it I think is funny enough I I did

432
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,290
honestly didn't think that I would go

433
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,690
through the whole game like this but I

434
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:35,430
like this a lot it was pretty funny I

435
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:36,890
would any in five nights at freddys fan

436
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,390
don't think it too seriously obviously

437
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,220
it's nice to just make fun of it every

438
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,360
once in a while and those guys obviously

439
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,880

440
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,470

444
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,110

15
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,789
enough to sponsor this video I designed

16
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,470
to look like the purple mushrooms in the

17
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,450
game I'm starting out by making a few

18
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,070
little straight pins with Stoppers that

19
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,469
look like the other objects in the game

20
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,910
using cardstock and glue while I share a

21
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,320
few things that they asked me to tell

22
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,300
you about if you haven't played it

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,530
before best fiends is a free puzzle game

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,450
that you can play with your friends if

25
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,039
you connect it to Facebook I don't level

26
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,870
42 at the moment but I keep getting

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
stuck maybe you'll be better at it than

28
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,910
I am

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,289

in-app currency for free now that we

34
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,320
need a place to keep these pins let's

35
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,030
get started on our mushroom pincushion

36
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,010
once you've cut out the pattern pieces

37
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,350
on a template I linked to in the video

38
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,060
description pin the largest shape onto a

39
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,400
piece of felt that's the color you want

40
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,060
the top of the mushroom to be and trim

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,770
around it

42
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,930
follow these steps for the rest of the

43
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,790
pieces in white felt and the quantity is

44
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,710
marked on the pattern so for example

45
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,320
you'll need two of this trapezoid shape

46
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,509
for the stem also treats around the

47
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,189
smaller circle on a spare piece of thin

48
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,500
cardboard which you'll need later to

49
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,970
keep the mushroom stable starting off

50
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,950
with your mushroom top we're going to

51
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,479
fold it along those cuts into the middle

52
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,700
and sew them together in order to make

53
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,470
it round and three-dimensional so

54
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,329
flatten the piece like this along the

55
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,920
first cut and stick a pin through both

56
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,320
layers so it'll stay put

57
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,810
we'll be sewing up the open edges right

58
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,700
here using whip stitch take a piece of

59
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,649
thread that matches your felt thread it

60
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,750
onto a sewing needle and tie a knot at

61
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,159
the end then start your needle up

62
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,630
through the corner between the two

63
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,060
layers of felt so your knot will be

64
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,250
hidden on the inside move your needle

65
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,049
around the side push it into the bottom

66
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,640
layer right across from your knot and as

67
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,469
you're pushing it through angle it

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,180
diagonally to the side of your first

69
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,759
stitch so it'll come out where you want

70
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,770
the next stitch to start pull it tight

71
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,980
and repeat that stitch all along the

72
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,780
open edge

73
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,730
you haven't used wit stitch before I'll

74
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,140
link to my more detailed sewing lesson

75
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,299
for it in the video description below

76
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,980
but it basically just makes these little

77
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:23,349
lines all along the edge and it works

78
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,030
really well for a project like this once

79
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,319
you reach the end of that line remove

80
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,180
the pin and push your needle down

81
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,549
through the felt so you can tie it off

82
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,230
on the underside to do this I like to

83
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,030
use my needle to grab one of the nearby

84
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,860
stitches and pull the needle through the

85
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,629
loop the thread makes that way the knot

86
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,910
stays right up against the fabric and

87
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,680
keeps the whole thing secure one more

88
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,450
time just in case then trim off the

89
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,030
excess and you're ready to start on the

90
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,650
next section the steps are the same for

91
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,620
each of these sections of this first

92
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,359
piece flatten it pin it in place start

93
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,459
in the corner between the two layers and

94
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,769
stitch up the side until you reach the

95
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,720
end of the raw edges then tie it off and

96
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:00,579
start again once you've done this on all

97
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,620
four sections your mushroom top should

98
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:04,629
look like this next I'm going to

99
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,940
decorate it with some white felt spots

100
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:08,950
I'm cutting out a bunch of little ovals

101
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,170
as my fabric scissors then sewing them

102
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,879
onto the mushroom top for this part I'm

103
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,010
tying a knot at the end of my thread and

104
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,900
starting from the underside poking my

105
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,720
needle up onto the edge of the first

106
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,280
spot then using whip stitch go all the

107
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,079
way around the spot making sure that

108
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,730
you're sewing through both the spot and

109
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,859
the mushroom top so it'll attach

110
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,569
securely when you get around to where

111
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,549
you started flip it over and tie a knot

112
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,650
using one of the nearby stitches as an

113
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,139
anchor like I showed you before you can

114
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,910
use as many or as few spots as you want

115
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,989
it's totally up to you and it will give

116
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,780
your mushroom it's own little

117
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,849
personality next grab the larger white

118
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,980
circle this will be the bottom side of

119
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:47,200
the mushroom top place the first piece

120
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,790
on top of the circle line up the edges

121
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
all the way around and pin it in place

122
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,889
now it kind of looks like a funny little

123
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,079
flying saucer or ravioli and we're going

124
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:57,790
to sew around the edges again starting

125
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,370
between the two layers to hide the knot

126
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,900
and using whip stitch try to keep your

127
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,400
stitches close together since we'll be

128
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,900
stuffing this little mushroom and we

129
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,030
don't want the stuffing to leak out of

130
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,769
the edges when you get an inch or two

131
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,599
away from where you started drop the

132
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,760
needle remove the pin grab some

133
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,680
polyester fiberfill and stuff it into

134
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,570
the gaps that you still have left to sew

135
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,340
the tighter you stuff this piece the

136
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,680
better it will grip any pins you stick

137
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,690
into it so try to push in as much of the

138
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,260
fluffy stuff as you can once you're

139
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,570
happy with it press the remain

140
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,850
gap closed and pin it shut pushing the

141
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,860
stuffing out of the way temporarily then

142
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,320
pick up your needle again and continue

143
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,180
to sew around to where you started this

144
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,160
time to secure it I just grabbed on to

145
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,680
the stitch where we started and tied two

146
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,540
little nuts on to that then to hide the

147
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,550
end of the thread push the needle into

148
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,190
the plush right where the knot was and

149
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,080
back out and inch or two away that way

150
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,810
when you tell them a thread and snip it

151
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,700
it disappears inside the shape yes all

152
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,980
right so now that we have our mushroom

153
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,170
top finished and squishy and cute all

154
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,090
that's left is to make the stem so it

155
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,130
will stand up grab the rest of the

156
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,940
pieces and starting with the two rounded

157
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,950
trapezoids

158
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,750
pin them together in a stack and sew up

159
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,030
the straight edges on the right and left

160
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,270
sides leaving what will be the circular

161
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,250
top and bottom open so like before start

162
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,620
in one corner between the layers to hide

163
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,020
your knot whip stitch up the side then

164
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,700
knot it off at the top repeat the same

165
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,950
for the other side and you should have a

166
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,830
tube with a small end and a larger end

167
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:27,560
the next step is to shows a small felt

168
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,150
circle onto the bottom of the stem the

169
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,670
cardboard piece we cut out will go

170
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,590
inside that so the base stays flat so I

171
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,960
trimmed it down to be a little smaller

172
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,490
than the felt circle I added a rolled

173
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,110
piece of scotch tape to stick the

174
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,900
cardboard to the felt so it wouldn't

175
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,850
slide around hold the base onto the tube

176
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,740
and with the new piece of thread sew

177
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,200
along the edge where they meet to attach

178
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,730
them together tie it off the same way we

179
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,950
did with the mushroom top and we're

180
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,900
ready to fill up the stem using some

181
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,740
pennies or other small weights and some

182
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,020
fiberfill

183
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,940
stuff the stem tightly I threw in the

184
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,740
coins to make the stem heavier than the

185
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,290
top so it wouldn't fall over

186
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,210
now all this left to do is attach the

187
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,250
top of the stem to the bottom of the

188
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,170
mushroom top hold them together using a

189
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,060
pin or two you kind of have to squish

190
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:13,550
the stem in order to make this work but

191
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,410
that's okay I know you can do it to show

192
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,750
these pieces together which is probably

193
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,610
the trickiest part alternate between a

194
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,280
stitch on the top and a stitch on the

195
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,730
stem as you go around if it doesn't feel

196
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,050
super secure go around a second time

197
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,790
it's okay if your stitches are messy

198
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,860
here since you won't really be able to

199
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,750
see them once it's finished pull the

200
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,580
pins out as you go so they don't get in

201
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,080
the way hide a double knot in there when

202
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,610
you're happy with it push the needle

203
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,289
through to hide your excess

204
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,710
trim the extra thread to finish up your

205
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:45,319
adorable little mushroom pin cushion and

206
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,080
now the moment of truth yes mine stands

207
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,419
up good news I was hoping that would

208
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,699
happen if yours doesn't you could take

209
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:54,340
those last stitches apart and add in a

210
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,750
few more pennies for extra stability

211
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,550
stand this little guy up on your desk

212
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,189
and you can either leave it like this or

213
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,110
use it to hold sewing pins like I am you

214
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,120
can make it any color you want make a

215
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,400
bunch of them and have fun with it I

216
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,560
really love little nature in woodland

217
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,870
inspired decorations so I'm personally

218
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,610
pretty excited to use this in my craft

219
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,349
studio if you make this mushroom

220
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,629
pincushion yourself post a photo on

221
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,550
social media and tag me at Lauren's Fair

222
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:21,050
WX so I can see how it came out

223
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,729
I love making crafts that remind me of

224
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,319
my favorite games and books so let me

225
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,610
know in the comments below what kind of

226
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,590
project you'd like to see me make next

227
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,460
thanks so much for watching happy

228
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:41,869
stitching and I'll see you soon

00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:13,110
good morning this is how we love to wake

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,379
up we definitely don't want to get out

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,578
of bed ever so we spend time cuddling

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,578

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,470
three stands to the highways through

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,570
shadow to the sunrays so while I'm

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,520
preparing coffee Angeles is usually

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,220
still in bed she's checking on her

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,080
social media and it actually wouldn't be

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,760
surprised if she was on the new game

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,120
that were obsessed with which is best

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,120
fiends

14
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,260
it's a highly addictive game we actually

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,770
compete against each other to see what

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:57,570
levels that we can get up to it's a fun

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,820
puzzle adventure in this month will turn

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,860
into a winter wonderland you get to

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,600
defeat slugs and collect fun characters

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,949
you can even connect with your Facebook

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,020

coffee

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,130

[Music]

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,840
so I'm definitely the one that you'll

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,290
see in the kitchen because I love

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,390
cooking and I want to prepare something

31
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,720
a bit more healthy today so having some

32
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,720
spinach and eggs and sweet potatoes

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,549
[Music]

34
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,600
I definitely always prepare something

35
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,130
we're in the mood for if we want

36
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,229
something sweet I usually go for french

37
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,000
toast and we mix things up in the

38
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,000
morning as long as it's a good meal

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,350
it's definitely best when we stay after

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,550
the bathroom while Angelus is doing her

41
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,550
morning ritual in there

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:34,890
[Music]

43
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,299
breakfast for us is super important

44
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,310
because really it's the only meal we get

45
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,650
to sit down together and enjoy because

46
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,110
once we leave I'm not back till after

47
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,110
dinnertime so we make it quality

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:03:04,010
[Music]

49
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,930
so after a quick cleanup we like to

50
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,720
generally sit down and watch the news

51
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,760
catch up on what's going on before we

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:20,720
have to get on our laptops and start our

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:22,730

50
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:07,500

67
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:19,129

[Music]

70
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,310
another thing I cleaned daily is my

71
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,010
kitchen countertops and I do this every

72
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,700
day and it makes me feel so much better

73
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,770
I am really weird about germs so I want

74
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,800
to make sure that all of my cleaning and

75
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,080
coastal areas are very sanitary and I do

76
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,770
this more than once a day so that I'm

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:56,730
able to collect my lunch and we can go

78
00:03:52,770 --> 00:04:01,410

80
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,510

[Music]

86
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,870
and one of the very last things that I

87
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,450
clean daily is the high chair and the

88
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,370
kitchen table I do this before meals and

89
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,680
after meals and one thing I like about

90
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,270
my creamy regime is it doesn't put too

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,820
much stress on me and something that I

92
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,280
do every day but it's not overwhelming

93
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,840
some things that I know that I can

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,460
accomplish every day so if I want a lazy

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,530
day and so going to be able to get

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,020

112,CHASE STOLE MY BEST FRIEND! Roblox #10: ESCAPE from SCHOOL OBBY! (FGTEEV Weird Roleplay),iOL7j2vmjME,"Chase & Duddy are doing some Roleplay in Roblox so we want to apologize for this weird video because we didn't plan to Roleplay but we kept getting crowded in the game from fans so we tried something different.  You can tell it's not planned because I'm a teenager who's in the 4th grade somehow haha. Oh goodness gracious please forgive us if you think this is a strange video. :)

00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:01,035
- Hey everyone!

2
00:00:01,035 --> 00:00:02,951
My name is Tyler Oakley
and here are some of

3
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:03,957
my favorite obsessions.

4
00:00:03,957 --> 00:00:05,041
Let's just go through 'em.

5
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,016
alyssa wants to know, ""What
is my current favorite song?""

6
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:09,340
I am really liking 11 Blocks.

7
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,270
I think it's by Wrabel or Wrabel?

8
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,271
I don't know how to pronounce it.

9
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:15,658
If you know, let me know,
but it's really good!

10
00:00:15,658 --> 00:00:16,883
If you wanna listen to it,
the link will be below.

11
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,991
I'll link you to my Spotify.

12
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:20,287
""What Starbucks drink
are you obsessed with?""

13
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,704
I am obviously very into my iced red eye,

14
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:27,241
which is coffee with
two shots of espresso,

15
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:31,056
with two splendas and a
little bit of skim milk

16
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,288
and light ice because I am obnoxious.

17
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:34,728
And you can tell that I love it so much

18
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:35,694
because I am almost done with it.

19
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:36,527
It's so good.

20
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:38,953
mandi says, ""Are you currently
obsessed with any TV shows?""

21
00:00:38,953 --> 00:00:41,589
I am almost all caught up
with Orange is the New Black.

22
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:43,763
Okay, I know I'm like forever behind,

23
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:46,269
but I'm about to finish the last season.

24
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,173
This most recent season just came out

25
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,691
and I'm not even on that yet.

26
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,666
I'm very slow.

27
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,052
maggie says, ""Favorite
song from Hamilton?""

28
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:57,008
I can't pick just one, so
if I had to pick a few,

29
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,243
Helpless is so good, Wait
For It is incredible,

30
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:04,637
but I think my favorite
song would have to be Burn.

31
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:08,190
It's like, oh my god, it's gut-wrenching.

32
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,091
If you like musical theater,

33
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,641
and you haven't given Hamilton a chance,

34
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,779
I don't know where you've been,

35
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:14,347
go listen to it and hopefully go see it.

36
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:16,656
I got to go see it and it
was the best thing ever.

37
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:20,415
I even got to meet Lin, can you imagine?

38
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:21,339
It was incredible.

39
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:22,878
sarah says, ""What is
your current favorite app

40
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:23,836
on your phone?""

41
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,770
This is so easy for me.

42
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,064
So, you guys know Matt
from the Amazing Race?

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,930
He made a video, sponsored by Best Fiends.

44
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,368
When you see a sponsor, you're like,

45
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,578
""Is this really a good thing?""

46
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:35,261
But then, I downloaded the game,

47
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:39,067
and I literally was playing
it all 4th of July weekend.

48
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,140
I am literally so obsessed with it that

49
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,181
I'm now on level 58, I
can't stop playing it.

50
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,138
And then I tweeted at them and I was like,

51
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:49,087
""Oh my god, why are you so addicting?""

52
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:51,424
And then they were like,
""We wanna sponsor a video.""

53
00:01:51,424 --> 00:01:53,719
So thank you to Best Fiends
for sponsoring this video.

54
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,524
So basically, I'mma lay it down for you.

55
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:57,698
Best Fiends is like this
puzzle adventure game.

56
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,677
You start all the way
down here at the bottom,

57
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:00,789
then you level all the way up,

58
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:02,675
and I have leveled up a lot so far,

59
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:04,507
and then you get all the way right here.

60
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:05,828
This is my current level,

61
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:07,279
and then you choose your little team,

62
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,694
and then you press start.

63
00:02:08,694 --> 00:02:10,945
You line up these things,

64
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,559
and then it breaks these things,

65
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:13,747
and then you use this,

66
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:15,523
and then there's a bomb over here that

67
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:16,908
I'm trying to explode but sometimes it's

68
00:02:16,908 --> 00:02:18,366
kinda hard to get the bomb.

69
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:20,142
You see that evil slug at the top?

70
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:23,013
This one has ice all
over it, it seems evil.

71
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:24,021
I'mma kill it, watch.

72
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,377
So basically you build up your team,

73
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:26,472
you kill the evil slugs,

74
00:02:26,472 --> 00:02:27,670
and if you know me you saw that

75
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,581
picture years ago when
I visited Zoella's home,

76
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,407
I was holding a slug and
terrified for my life,

77
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,249
I am here to kill the evil slugs.

78
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,414
If you get the app, which you should,

79
00:02:36,414 --> 00:02:39,335
'cause I wanna know updates of
you guys playing it with me,

80
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,999
there is gonna be a
free gift on July 10th.

81
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,962
And when I told all my friends
from 4th of July weekend that

82
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:44,983
that was happening, they were like,

83
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,192
""What is happening?""

84
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:48,259
So get the game and play on July 10th

85
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:49,549
and you're gonna get that free gift.

86
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,888
You can download the game
for free with the link below.

87
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:53,497
There are new levels available now.

88
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,666
Bay says, ""What's a word you've
been using a lot recently?""

89
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,183
Sister. (laughs)

90
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:00,487
If you saw my last video you know why.

91
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:01,821
I've been saying it all the time.

92
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:05,046
I'm sorry, I can't help
it, I'm like sister.

93
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,630
""What is your favorite
face or hair product that

94
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,879
you've used this month?""

95
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,419
I have been using this, it's
Big Sexy Hair Powder Play.

96
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,636
You sprinkle it in your hair if

97
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:14,367
you want it to be thickened up

98
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,453
and malleable in the
direction that you want,

99
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,362
but without it being too product-y.

100
00:03:18,362 --> 00:03:19,548
But you can get it any brand.

101
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:20,642
I've used multiple brands,

102
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,511
I just get this because it's the one that

103
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:25,599
I could find at the hair place
that's close to my Target.

104
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,222
Any type of texture powder
I'm really into right now.

105
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:29,364
I like this one, but I don't know if

106
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,391
there's better ones out there.

107
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,285
I'mma keep trying them,
I'll keep you guys informed.

108
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:34,030
Mickia says, ""Favorite ice cream flavor?""

109
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,549
The other day I was very hungover,

110
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,619
and you know when nothing seems
to be curing the situation

111
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:40,689
and everything is going
wrong and you're sweating,

112
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,449
you have a headache and
noises are killing you,

113
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,478
and you try to sleep
but nothing's working?

114
00:03:46,478 --> 00:03:49,131
The one thing that cured my situation

115
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:50,565
was an orange creamsicle!

116
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,650
And it was the best thing of all-time,

117
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,633
and it's like, ugh, it was so good.

118
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,738
So I'mma say an orange creamsicle.

119
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:56,671
Perfect for the summer.

120
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,301
Jordan says, ""What is your
favorite vidcon memory?""

121
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:02,513
There's one moment that I
really loved is with Shannon,

122
00:04:02,513 --> 00:04:05,023
and she is an Irish viewer
that I got to hang out with,

123
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,501
and we were hanging out
in this beanbag room,

124
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:10,138
and me and Korey and her all lept

125
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:12,875
and jumped into the beanbags all at once.

126
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,897
Vidcon can be kind of stressful,

127
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:16,940
but when you have times when it's like,

128
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,640
get away and actually get to know people,

129
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,157
that's what Vidcon's all about.

130
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:22,018
madi wants to know my
current favorite album.

131
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,925
I would obviously have to say Pride Jams,

132
00:04:23,925 --> 00:04:26,167
which if you want a signed
copy the link is below,

133
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,580
and I don't think I
showed you this before,

134
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,856
but the back is so cute.

135
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,577
It has all the titles of the songs on it

136
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:32,229
and a little rainbow, it's so adorable.

137
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:33,146
I really love it.

138
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:35,215
A portion of the proceeds
goes toward the Trevor Project

139
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,635
and it supports LGBTQ+ artists,

140
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:39,157
so win-win situation and
you get some good music.

141
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:41,241
mckenzie says, ""Current
vegetable obsession?""

142
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,646
I don't know! (laughs)

143
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:43,537
Cherry tomatoes?

144
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:44,866
I really like a cherry
tomato in the summer.

145
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,612
You can pop 'em in ya mouth all day.

146
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:49,179
Delicious, like a grape, it's so good.

147
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,821
joetta says, ""Favorite board game?""

148
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:52,413
Okay, so if you like Settlers of Catan,

149
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,185
I'm really currently into,
it's called Lords of Waterdeep.

150
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,364
I used to play it back in
Michigan with all my family,

151
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,631
and then I introduced it to
my friends here in California,

152
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,218
and we all really like it.

153
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,232
We get kind of competitive though.

154
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,431
It's cutthroat.

155
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,407
nina says, ""Favorite
finger at the moment?""

156
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:09,682
I don't know if I have a favorite finger.

157
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:12,013
Maybe this one (laughing) I don't know.

158
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,349
kayla says, ""What's your favorite
thing to wear right now?""

159
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:15,719
Well, right now I think
I'm a little biased

160
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:16,751
because I'm wearing right now,

161
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,601
I don't know if you can see it,

162
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,251
it's this Lady Gaga ""Born This Way"" shirt.

163
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,388
It's lyrics from ""Highway Unicorn"",

164
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,852
which is my favorite Lady
Gaga song of all-time.

165
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,523
But also, I am very partial to this

166
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:29,714
Make America Gay Again
hat, it's from the HRC.

167
00:05:29,714 --> 00:05:31,435
If you wanna get it,
I'll put the link below.

168
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,121
""Favorite reality show competition?""

169
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,472
Obviously, right now I'm
obsessed with Big Brother.

170
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:36,574
Are you guys watching it?

171
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:37,616
I'm not gonna spoil anything,

172
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,644
but that second eliminated houseguest.

173
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:44,105
Can we talk about, like, just ludicrous.

174
00:05:44,105 --> 00:05:46,114
Okay, so those are some
of my current obsessions.

175
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,381
I wanna know, what is your
current favorite song right now.

176
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,407
Let me know in the comments below.

177
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,273
That's all I have for you guys today.

178
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:53,841
I love you, I'll see you guys soon.

179
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:55,282
Okay, that's all, bye!

180
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:57,820
(lively music)

181
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,320
Bam, boom, got it.

decided to roast every picture

63
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,350

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,770

that's only on tinder for news but he's

67
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,880
too afraid to ask for them honestly my

68
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,380
life every kid after listening to asking

69
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,450
alexandria for five minutes

70
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,470
there is no lie it's time to get rid of

71
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,000
MySpace

72
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,900
honestly the bad part is that picture

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,030
never even reached myspace that last

74
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,540
picture looks like a Walmart version of

75
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,540
Kingsley we're going there today

76
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,840
this one's hurting my feelings bruh

77
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,700
that first one looks like a kid from my

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,530
elementary school who thought he was a

79
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,250
professional rapper because he listened

80
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,530
to one Eminem song Wow how did you know

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:07,270
I guess you're still waiting for that

85
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,890

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,010
didn't believe me before about how much

96
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,050
the sex icon Pennywise is like what

97
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,710

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,180

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,640
[Music]

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,760
next to be none other than the gay icon

101
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,770
the babadook okay so for this one it's

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:06,520
gonna be a another crazy makeup look but

103
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:09,850

the Hat as the gay icon that the

00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:27,490
babadook is needs to support the

108
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:30,280
community the sex appeal is the BAA

109
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:40,240
verdict is undeniable I've never felt

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:44,050
sexier next I have a media sex icon and

111
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,320
the only thing that may be even close to

112
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,810

113
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,460

[Music]

122
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:23,510

123
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,490

if you study with the Pomodoro Technique

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,490
you probably make a 10 minute break

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,840
between two blocks of studying sessions

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,430
sometimes you are so overwhelmed with

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,010
studying that you don't know what to do

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,019
during those 10 minutes I have a few

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:34,710
tips on how to optimize that time to

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:36,360
make your setting efficient and fun make

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,070
a very quick outline of what you've just

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,050
learned these are going to be

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,879
necessarily pretty notes just a very

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,620
quick summary of the main aspects of the

13
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,420
materials you have just read so you can

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,329
refer back to them very quickly during

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,910
revision I've currently reached level 30

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,770
on best fiends a puzzle battle game with

17
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,660
tons of characters you can collect and

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,239
build a team with in order to defeat the

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,859
slugs they were kind enough to sponsor

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
this video and are giving away a free

21
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,960
gift on June 19th to celebrate Father's

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,240
Day make sure to play the game on that

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,020

link below to download the game for free

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:17,369
it is also important to get help while

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,110
studying I particularly like to use my

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,060
10 minute break to write down any

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,860
questions I have about what I've just

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,509
finished studying and try to get someone

30
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,509
to help me answer those questions

31
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,400
if you can resort your friends or

32
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,710
professors I highly recommend school an

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,300
online tutoring service with license and

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,020
teachers that can help with science

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,760
maths languages business you name it

36
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,160
school is also an amazing resource if

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,330
you are preparing for final exams or if

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,400
you need to strengthen your knowledge

39
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:52,320
during summer all-day or get help for

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,240
your homework write down a list with the

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,640
main keywords of the notes or textbook

42
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,259
you've just studied this can come in

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,570
handy if you are thinking about making

44
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,729
flashcards to prepare for future tests

45
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,680
and exams you can also test your

46
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,330
knowledge on these definitions just by

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,369
looking at this list from time to time

48
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,679
to see if you still remember what you

49
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,420
mean

50
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,730
make sure to prepare your study sessions

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,890
by dividing your tasks in terms of time

52
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,470
and note down everything in a to-do list

53
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,360
or your bullet journal I like to take my

54
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,519
ten minute break to look through my list

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,650
check down each one of the topics and

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,239
chapters I've already studied and see

57
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,470
what else I need to get done until the

58
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,209
end of the tape if my study session

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,310
consisted mainly on reading

60
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,830
I normally highlight the most important

61
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,330
keywords as I'm studying and I use my 10

62
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,549
minute break to go through all of the

63
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,769
material and just look at what I have

64
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,780
highlighted trying to see if I really

65
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:47,160
understood information or if I need to

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,739
review it a few more times

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,780
it takes a very short amount of time to

68
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,630
do and it helps consolidate what you've

69
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,620
read

70
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,750
I hope you found these very simple tips

watching Curtin vs. pin today is very

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,349
exciting can you feel it can you feel

three kinds of difficult pins but also

we're hashtags box that's kind of hard

rob has a filthy skin mouth that's right

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,949
best fiends forever yeah we all love the

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,140
game I'm sure you've heard of it before

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
well the new version in the trilogy is

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,790
available for free download right now

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,129
link in the description this game is

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,500
completely different than the one before

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,390
it all the characters are still the same

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,789
which is good because I think they're

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,399
really cute and I'd be sad if they

19
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:50,520
weren't there anymore but this version

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,039
is way more addicting I got to level 75

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,710
in one city that's probably partly

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,980
because I have no actual real friends

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,969
it's definitely the most fun you'll have

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:06,030
with your fingers as always on the rare

25
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,220
occasion when we have a sponsor we like

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,229
to do a giveaway so make sure to stay

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,540
tuned till the end of the video for all

28
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,290
the details on Beth's let's get to

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,619
making some shoes now I'm a little crazy

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,140
I don't know I think a lot about things

31
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,159
and I really wanted my last video of

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,770
October to be really special so I came

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,409
up the idea to do very light jars

34
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,380
because they've been suggested a bunch

35
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:37,140
of times but I couldn't just do any old

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,780
fairy light jars because you know I

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,610
gotta do things bigger and better so the

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,490
idea kind of spiraled out of control and

39
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,939
yeah you'll see you'll see but hopefully

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,369
this helps you realize all your fairy

41
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:55,610
godmother dreams let's get started shall

42
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,610
we

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,450
okay so first up we're starting with the

44
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,950
ever famous light up fairy jars or

45
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,650
whatever you want to call them now we've

46
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,950
all seen the version that says they use

47
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,800
glow-in-the-dark paint but sorry those

48
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:16,410
don't really work that great as I recall

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,750
Rob tried them once and they were a

50
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,480
disappointment you can also break open

51
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,990
some glow sticks and create the glowing

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,680
effect that way but it doesn't last very

53
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,930
long

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,740
and then you just have a dead fairy jar

55
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,200
which is that my favorite of the light

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,100
of fairy jars that I've seen use a

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,440
string lights

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,080
obviously that works the best because

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,210
they're actual lights that light up

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,850
using batteries but I think they look

61
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,220
pretty sad with just the string light in

62
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,220
a jar right where's the fun in that

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:53,040
so I'm thinking that we should add all

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,330
kinds of court and crystals and

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,010
gemstones in there but unfortunately

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,730
those things are really expensive yeah

67
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,840
like this one not cheap so what's the

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,959
next best thing

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,510
kiai ye our own that's right we're gonna

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,570
make some gems out of paper i found this

71
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,110
website that has some printable 3d gem

72
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,070
shapes and voila printing them out I'm

73
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,750
gonna do a small D and a big D cuz

74
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,630
sometimes you just need a big D in your

75
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,520
life you know then yeah and I did some

76
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,040
other shapes too but those aren't as

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,620
funny anyway first I'm working with the

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,590
small shape so I'm gluing all of those

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,510
to the backside of some hollow paper I

80
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,540
know you guys love to hear about the

81
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,640
hollow whatever haters you know this is

82
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,220
cool-looking and I think it's actually

83
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,190
gonna work really well in emulating my

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,959
rainbow quartz color me happy now you

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,650
have to very carefully cut them out

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,130
along the solid lines and then score all

87
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,770
of the lines like this

88
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,080
this is called scoring like keeping

89
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,480
score nobody's keeping score here I know

90
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
y'all are keeping score though can't

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,160
make one little mistake can I okay I

92
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,810
think this is folded to its proper

93
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,300
fuzziness now I'm going to use this

94
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,910
double-sided adhesive that's super

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,459
strong it takes a little bit longer to

96
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,830
cut all the little pieces and get

97
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,710
everything in there like it needs to be

98
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,470
but I really like how it's turning out

99
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:31,010
yes look at this my new favorite thing

100
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,740
ever it's so Hollow and beautiful so

101
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,220
winning the penny I know I hate myself

102
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,960
too

103
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,600
this could be why I have no friends

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,130
maybe hey now I'm gonna spend the next 4

105
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,800
hours making the rest of these things

106
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,440
but again doesn't really matter because

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,210
of that no friends situation yeah I

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,620
don't leave my house fair to opt it I

109
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,160
don't really have anything better to do

110
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,320
so 3d paper jams here we go best fiends

111
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,830
forever and ever and ever

112
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,800
ok moving on first I have to spray paint

113
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,070
the lid of my jar gold because I can't

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,180
be having this basic a jar lid on my

115
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,310
light-up fairy jar

116
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,440
oh no and while that's drying I'm gonna

117
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,290
be adding some reindeer moss yeah

118
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,310
fucking reindeer moss this stuff is

119
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,990
about cups just so fluffy I love it

120
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,540
yeah I'm gonna be adding some of that to

121
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,550
the bottom of the jar look at it like a

122
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,250
little world down there the world I

123
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,100
control

124
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,870
I also added some twigs yeah you want to

125
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,450
get Twiggy with it now I'm super

126
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,570
strategically adding all of my gems to

127
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,390
the jar yes this is coming along quite

128
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,280
nicely but what the fuck gold paint

129
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,600
this isn't gold this doesn't look like

130
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,640
the lid at all

131
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,810
major disappointment why'd you have to

132
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,910
lie to me like that

133
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,890
luckily I've been saving this gold leaf

134
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,140
from a project I did like five years ago

135
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,480
that's right this is some craft or

136
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,730
justification right here thanks for not

137
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,130
letting me down leftover gold leaf see

138
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,470
this is what gold is supposed to look

139
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,870
like spray-paint just so you know here's

140
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,260
a reference yeah anyway and it looks

141
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,450
pretty

142
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,460
now I just have to unbox my string

143
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,800
lights wait a minute what is this

144
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,780
batteries already included put that in

145
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,550
your pipe and smoke it just cut Andy oh

146
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,630
you don't know who jessica tandy is you

147
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,120
can google it later

148
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,700
yes okay so I'm just putting the lights

149
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,310
down in the jar like this and then

150
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,050
clamping the end of the strand to the

151
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,420
top of my jar with this very

152
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,730
professional crafting clamp thing

153
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,980
definitely not used for hair lastly I

154
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,650
just glued some felt to the inside of

155
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,450
the lid like a disc to create a little

156
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,600
loop so my battery pack can live in

157
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,760
there genius and then I just glued the

158
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,660
remaining gems to the top of the lid and

159
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,630
skin booyakasha light up fairy jar this

160
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,940
is how you fairy jar the boobs as much

161
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,190
as I love my new light-up fairy jar this

162
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,800
really isn't helping me realize my full

163
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,930
fairy godmother potential so we have

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,600
some more projects to knock out the next

165
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,880
one being the good old lace tiara this

166
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,630
project has been suggested a gazillion

167
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,730
times

168
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,130
ellee's anyway for this I'm going to be

169
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,320
using a couple types of this fancy lace

170
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,880
here and when you go to the store to buy

171
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,880
this you want to make sure to only get a

172
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,610
little bit because this is expensive we

173
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,680
don't need a whole bunch Hey

174
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,990
reel it in a little bit okay so I'm just

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,940
pouring some Mod Podge into a bowl here

176
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,460
and then mixing a little bit of water

177
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,550
into it hey there water drop how you

178
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,919
doing oh you're an inanimate object and

179
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,280
you're not real that hasn't stopped me

180
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,290
before

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,320
has it okay now I'm just dunking my lace

182
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,050
pieces into the mixture and then forming

183
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,940
them around this styrofoam cone thing I

184
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,560
got from the craft store I'm pretty sure

185
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,510
these are used for like flowers or

186
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,850
something I don't really know what I do

187
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,729
know is that it works perfectly for my

188
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,729
purposes and that's all that matters in

189
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:58,010
my little world isn't it and I even had

190
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,800
a little bit left over so I'm making a

191
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,780
tiny one for my kidney cuz my kitty also

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,750
needs a lace tiara

193
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,940
hashtag spoiled okay while those are

194
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,430
drying I'm moving on to our third and

195
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,789
final project of the day the light-up

196
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,030
tulle skirt oh no it's exciting isn't it

197
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:19,490
I got this pre-made tulle skirt from my

198
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,380
local fabric store and I think it's

199
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,389
really cute okay

200
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,830
you're embarrassing all of us see this

201
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:26,479
is why you don't have any friends and

202
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,419
the ones he's not helping either

203
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,510
so embarrassing yeah anyway I ordered

204
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,060
three purple on black battery-operated

205
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,640
light strands from the good old Internet

206
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,469
and what the fuck no batteries included

207
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,810
in these ones that's okay though because

208
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,099
I have some batteries thank goodness

209
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,930
knodel's gonna have to end the whole

210
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:48,050
video here all right so I'm just

211
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,150
carefully panning the battery pack to

212
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,220
the back of the skirt like this and then

213
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,770
carefully pinning the rest of the light

214
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,089
strand to strategic locations on the

215
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,160
underside of the tulle

216
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,410
all right once I have the Strand pin in

217
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,600
all the proper locations then I just

218
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,580
took out my trusty needle and thread and

219
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,430
sewed some stitches in all of those

220
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,220
little locations then I simply repeated

221
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,440
that process with a second light strand

222
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,589
and kind of pin that one in different

223
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,720
locations so there was a nice

224
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:19,250
distribution of Lights throughout the

225
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,840
tulle skirt

226
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,300
I'm saying yeah this is gonna be

227
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,930
different because no tulle skirts are

228
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,980
the same yes I'm very happy with how

229
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,530
this turned out

230
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,260
look at this shit the goddamn light-up

231
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:34,970
dreams okay I think our tiaras are

232
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,730
probably dry yeah they're looking pretty

233
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,370
good I am happy with them all I gotta do

234
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,800
is unpin them and then carefully remove

235
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,150
the plastic wrap from the styrofoam form

236
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,680
and voila

237
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,780
lace tiaras Tiaras tiaras but you know

238
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,720
what I can't have just regular old lace

239
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,300
tiara no let's light this bitch up

240
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,880
yeah I'm simply creating a felt bottom

241
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,640
and then adding a headband and securing

242
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,610
that with some felt as well then I added

243
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,620
my battery pack to the inside here

244
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:09,200
covered that with the more felt and boom

245
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,420
we got ourselves some headlights yeah

246
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,390
and when you put this all together it

247
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,900
looks fucking fantastic fairy godmother

248
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,960
dreams realized and it's all done just

249
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,770
in time for me to live my goddamn

250
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,480
everyday life okay I don't need

251
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:30,560
Halloween to dress up like a fairy

252
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:34,190
godmother so know that okay I think that

253
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,400
is definitely all the DIY we can handle

254
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,410
for one video but that's okay because

255
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:42,500
this brings me to the most exciting part

256
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,930
of the video and that stickies away as a

257
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,360
thank you to you for putting up with all

258
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:51,170

tell me that we're going to do a spooky

5

answer your questions we're going to

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,420
jump right in to the first question here

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,910
on twitter twitter users Bridget asks

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,210
favorite horror movies I really enjoy a

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,740
good supernatural paranormal thriller

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,460
something with psychological horror and

13
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:41,040
torture elements like this dog is doing

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:43,290
to my hands I really did enjoy the

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,770
insidious series okay I can't keep this

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,329
voice up

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,640
I really enjoyed the insidious series

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,020
although I did have a weird feeling when

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,570
they made the villain and one of them

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,949
like basically she's trans she's a trans

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,350
woman and she kills people and she's

22
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,730
those are synonymous because of the way

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,079
her mother treated her as its kid and

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,789
she's really dude

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,530
it was much bullshit I didn't like that

26
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,520
but I thought it that the scares and

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,750
everything were really good in the

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,180
insidious series all three movies

35
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,170
you've had I experienced sleep paralysis

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,970
fairly often not to the degree where it

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,549
affects my life in any negative way but

38
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,799
I do I like to believe that sleep

39
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,780
paralysis is some kind of interesting

40
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,430
little secret visit from spirit I don't

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,340
know that's how I would like to view it

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,750
and it makes me experience it cooler I

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,250
don't know I just like I like

44
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,329
experiencing it in that context

45
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,890
otherwise I would just be scared

46
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,299
shitless so that's how I think of it and

47
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,360

Twitter user Gengar if you became a

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,489
ghost do you think you would be a

81
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,230
hopeful spirit or a trickster I would

82
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,150
love to feel I would love to believe

83
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,920
that it'd be a helpful spirit like maybe

84
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,450
a taunt like you know trans girls and

85
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,400

don't eat my fingers you little monster

90
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,900
but I have a lot of problems with the

91
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,360
concept of mortality it scares the shit

92
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,970
out of me I don't like it so you know

93
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,930
existing for you know at least an

94
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,090
extended period of time

95
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,010
as spirit would be interesting to me I

96
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,959
would like back over nothing over

97
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,400
blackness I would like that yeah even

98
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,900
reincarnation kind of scares me because

99
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,310
I don't want to you know forget my

100
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,480
experiences of this life I don't want to

101
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,160
be a different person I want to be this

102
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,060

girl well beasty boo Twitter user bone

special oh okay

113
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:34,060
twitter user melissa lo lopez melissa

114
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:36,100
lopez candy corn yes or hell no it is my

115
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,230
belief that candy corn is abomination is

116
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,820
an abomination is the one thing that I

117
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,710
believe is an abomination I can't

118
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,540
remember ever actually tasting it but I

119
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,030
just remember thinking it was putrid so

120
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,580
candy corn is a no from me it's a note

121
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,020
from a Twitter user Nina do you have any

122
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,640
special Halloween traditions that you

123
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,620
remember from being a child and from

124
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,360
home and did your creativity express

125
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,070
itself through Halloween activities when

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,560
you were younger so I remember we used

127
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,870
to make these really creepy witch faces

128
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,030
over the apples which is kind of funny

129
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,660
now because like obviously witches don't

130
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,400
look like that

131
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,840
but you know that's what I thought as a

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,850
child that which is really creepy scary

133
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,500
old ladies so we make those little apple

134
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,790
witches and I really enjoyed that I

135
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,140
thought it was really cool and it was

136
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,250
terrifying and I'll put a link to an

137
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,810
article that shows you how to do that in

138
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,460
the description box maybe if I can find

139
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,920
one because this was like a 90s crack

140
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,900
thing super cute I mean we always went

141
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,370
trick-or-treating though and I was part

142
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,830
of a big family so it was usually like

143
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,330
five or six kids together not all my

144
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,800
siblings but we were all we will go

145
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,540
together it was really it was really fun

146
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,400
I really enjoyed that usually if I can't

147
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,920
put my ring in the front instead of my

148
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,840
hand she'll stop or because she doesn't

149
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,690
want to chew on metal she wants to chew

150
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,510
on flesh and I don't want you to chew in

151
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,110
my flesh Lizzie I don't like that can

152
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,820
you stop it

153
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,040
Twitter use a professional fangirl what

154
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,290
is your favorite candy I don't eat candy

155
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,520
as much as I used to the sugar I don't

156
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,980
know it doesn't sit right with me in my

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,780
stomach anymore in large quantities but

158
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,890
I do love fuzzy peaches and you guys

159
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,570
don't have those in the United States

160
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,550
and it makes me very very very sad very

161
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,800
very sad they're kind of like sour and

162
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,060
sweet so but fuzzy peaches my Manor it's

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,500
my absolute favorite candy what

164
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,570
Halloween themed movies do you like to

165
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,689
watch I always love watching Harry

166
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,429
Potter around the Halloween

167
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,379
Christmas seasons not because I think

168
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:16,379
magic and Wizardry in witchcraft earnest

169
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,329
Tilly Halloweeny but because the winter

170
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,979
and the fall scenes and Harry Potter are

171
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:20,669
absolutely incredible and they make me

172
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,919
so happy

173
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,629
twitter user months there at oh no

174
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,369
there's a Halloween war going on quickly

175
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,079
choose fight with the magical monsters

176
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:31,199
of the normal but very strong ones I'm

177
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,539
guessing you mean like by with like you

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,309
know magical like blue fireballs and you

179
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,889
know arcane shit or you mean fighting

180
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:39,329
super big brawny monsters like witches

181
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:40,979
side would I be on I would like to be

182
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:43,110
with the magical monsters because I love

183
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:46,610
you know magic and stuff and I like I

184
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,139
think subtlety has a place in in

185
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,929
conflict you know and I feel like that

186
00:06:49,139 --> 00:07:04,499
would be more my strength than just

187
00:06:51,929 --> 00:07:06,419
mashing Twitter user Sam what frightened

188
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:10,019
you when you were a child I used to be

189
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,789
so scared of the witch went to Snow

190
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:12,989
White when she was an old lady she's

191
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:14,369
scared the crap out of me

192
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,869
and I used to be this specific thing

193
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:18,089
where I wrapped my comforter around my

194
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,709
head and like just had my eyes peeking

195
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,029
out when I went to bed because I thought

196
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,919
she wouldn't be able to find me like

197
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:24,449
that for some reason very specifically

198
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,189
with her but like other monsters to be

199
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,929
able to find me but not her when I was

200
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:31,379
like that I don't know I also was really

201
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:32,999
scared of this cupboard in my closet as

202
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,139
a child which is really creepy now that

203
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,300
I think about it and I'm pretty sure my

204
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,269
mom said that I said there was a man in

205
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,129
my closet once anyway in my closet in my

206
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,689
childhood bedroom there was a door in

207
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:44,759
the closet it was like really really

208
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:46,229
short it probably came up to about here

209
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,509
when the floor is like pretty much like

210
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,219
a foot below this okay so it was like a

211
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,110
foot high a foot high door and it used

212
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,869
to scare me because it was just a black

213
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,319
little box room it's terrifying Twitter

214
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,389
user

215
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,129
catch what's a Halloween costume you've

216
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,039
always wanted but haven't had it yet I

217
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:04,379
oh look at you used to good girl

218
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,149
music your belly check your where your

219
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,810
boo bleep Oh bleep ugly I have always

220
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:12,470
wanted to be either poison ivy

221
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,820
or road from x-men for obvious reasons

222
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,560
the poison ivy I've always wanted to be

223
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,419
because like when I was a kid I would

224
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,230
watch the Batman movies and I was so

225
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:23,180
intrigued by the way she would use like

226
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,980
her femininity and her sexuality as a

227
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,930
weapon which was you know in hindsight

228
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,430
kind of bad writing but I was a kid it

229
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,600
was not that and it wasn't that I was

230
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,240
like attracted to her either

231
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,650
but it was like it was a fascination and

232
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,419
I think that's really cool Twitter these

233
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,570
are Beth do you believe in ghosts or an

234
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,669
afterlife of some kind so I I have this

235
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,589
odd belief system that's like a

236
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:50,300
combination of old Celtic things and

237
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:53,000
environmentalism and like physics you

238
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,490
know I believe that energy cannot be

239
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,970
created or destroyed just transferred so

240
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:02,000
I also believe that there is an energy

241
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,339
in our being not just in our physical

242
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,440
cells and it might be like a physical

243
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:07,910
like electric thing you know it's

244
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,530
something like that and I believe that

245
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,020
has to do something I don't know what it

246
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,550
does okay I don't but I know it returns

247
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,350
to the earth or it returns to the Stars

248
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,120
and one of those two things I'm happy

249
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,130
with it as long as I have some kind of I

250
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,730
just want to be conscious after I die

251
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,740
which sounds like bullshit and I kind of

252
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,170
don't I don't have a belief that I will

253
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,760
be but I want to be you know that's what

254
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,410
I'm thinking twitter user house a bulk

255
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,940
do you carve a pumpkin or eat loads of

256
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,460
pumpkin spice stuff I don't really carve

257
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,530
pumpkins because I I tend to view that

258
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,940
as like something for kids and I just

259
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,589
thought that I think I'm too old for it

260
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,850
but is that there's no kids in my life

261
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,680
that you know would be able to

262
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,480
appreciate pumpkin because I'm not that

263
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,010
good with a knife and I wouldn't be able

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,830
to carve a pumpkin in a spectacular

265
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,200
fashion you know so I don't do that

266
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,690
but pumpkin spice stuff actually made me

267
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,850
cry in a video from two years ago or so

268
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,530
and I will insert that clip now favorite

269
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:00,260
hot drink for the winter so I know

270
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,850
winter is not fall but I still go to

271
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,940
Starbucks and order pumpkin spice lattes

272
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,279
all the time there is so Hardy and make

273
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,860
me feel really happy

274
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,660
and I just like them a lot so I'm gonna

275
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,129
keep ordering them in the winter and

276
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,529
they still make them for me at the

277
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:22,269
Starbucks then I go to so I'm really

278
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:27,309
happy about that but it meant home

279
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:33,360
I just got in massive mitts Wow oh hi

280
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:33,360
HRT what's up okay but if I'm at home oh

281
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:41,769
I'm so happy if I went home I like

282
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:44,170
having a hot chocolate because the hot

283
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,569
chocolate is really good too so hot

284
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,519
chocolate but if I'm out pumpkin spice

285
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:50,079
latte I don't care that it's not fall

286
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,720
anymore that's my favorite winter drink

287
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,329
I love pumpkin spice coffee more than

288
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,240
anything in this world I'm tearing up

289
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:02,199
right now thinking about pumpkin spice

290
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,959
coffee do you see this shit I love

291
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:08,019
pumpkin spice almost as much as I love

292
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:11,350
bread and that is you know a real a real

293
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:13,750
tough battle right there so that's how I

294
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,699
feel about your question thank you

295
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,889
twitter user Tom have you seen the new

296
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:20,050
hit movie if so did you like it I loved

297
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,930
it so I saw it first and then I watched

298
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,990
the old one after and I was not

299
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:28,569
impressed by the old one and obviously

300
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,670
it's been like 20 years 27 years it's

301
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:32,350
been a while okay so that movie is aged

302
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,360
but I also feel like you know the

303
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:36,339
writing was weaker everything was weak

304
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,139
with the first movie and I don't know if

305
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,740
there was some bullshit in the air in

306
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,839
1990 that just made movies bad okay but

307
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,059
it was a bad movie then the new one is

308
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,740
an absolute masterpiece and it was

309
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,809
terrifying and it was fantastic twitter

310
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,069
user shall be creepy cookie other than

311
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,720
pumpkin spice lattes what's your

312
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:56,079
favorite part of Halloween slush bottom

313
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,559
I love layering clothes I love fall

314
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,390
fashion I love wearing all black I love

315
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:02,760
this

316
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,840
sound of leaves crunching under your

317
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,410
feet gives me tingles every time so

318
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,150
that's great

319
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,650
twitter user candy have you had any be

320
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,350
occurring nightmares that stuck with you

321
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,850
no but reading your question made me

322
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,860
think of an experience I had last night

323
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,240
in my home right on this couch I fell

324
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,230
asleep on the couch last night watching

325
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,550
the office ok the office definitely

326
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,380
that's important just remember it when I

327
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,450
would close my eyes I would immediately

328
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,640
fall into a dream state it was pitch

329
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:31,740
black immediately and I would hear this

330
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:36,750
creepy voice talking to me

331
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:39,240
and last night specifically it said and

332
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,070
I flashed my eyes open and suddenly like

333
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,300
the blackness that was so black wasn't

334
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,650
so black anymore I don't know how to

335
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,030
describe it but it was like when I close

336
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,550
my eyes again it wasn't as black as it

337
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,690
was before I opened them I don't know

338
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,730
how to describe that it was like

339
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,560
immediately I heard the office again and

340
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,750
that voice is gone and that voice would

341
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,490
not be in the office ok and it was like

342
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,090
I did not hear the office when I close

343
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,350
my eyes

344
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,870
how does some creepy kidnapping ghosts

345
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,760
in my house but whatever you know he

346
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,640
can't kidnap me Twitter uses Scarlett

347
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,990
Burnett vampire or werewolf you know do

348
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,180
I have to choose ok

349
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:14,490
I love vampires for the freaking style

350
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,740
and their immortality very interesting

351
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,230
concept to me but werewolves I like the

352
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,380
concept of you know uninhibited raw

353
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,970
feral emotion like just just doing what

354
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,520
you do but there's no self-control there

355
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:31,140
so I'm not sure I'm probably get up to

356
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,730
say vampires yeah unfortunately sorry

357
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,350
where we'll put our user Sarah Nicole

358
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,300
what is one spooky villain you would

359
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,530
have played as if but you would have

360
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,030
played as if you got the role Oh spooky

361
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,670
villain I would play as if I got the

362
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,460
role spooky villain this is gonna sound

363
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,980
really odd but you know the judge from

364
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,140
Quasimodo or from The Hunchback of Notre

365
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,120
Dame I think I would love to play him as

366
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,529
a woman character because I love the

367
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,019
songs that he sings I think a fantastic

368
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:01,299
and I hate that character like I hate

369
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:04,209
him because he's written to be a real

370
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:06,579
like there's dudes like that entitled

371
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,559
and then vengeful when you reject their

372
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,959
advances it's creepy anyway I love that

373
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,579
character and if it was a woman I would

374
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,179
play the shit ever twitter user spooky

375
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,769
bitch

376
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:16,329
did you watch stranger things season 1

377
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:20,319
and how excited are you for season 2 if

378
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:22,839
you did I stranger I loved

379
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:24,309
wenona writers character so much I loved

380
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,599
seeing mom characters that aren't just

381
00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:27,219
complacent and don't just sit around

382
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:28,779
like they actually they actually do

383
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:31,359
something when their child's in danger I

384
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,639
love that season 2 I have very excited

385
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:35,349
for season 2 I love that creepy Slender

386
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,049
Man esque monster that they keep having

387
00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:39,759
in the previews and I have no idea where

388
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,469
they're going with that monster and I'm

389
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,719
ready to learn about it I am and I'm

390
00:14:41,469 --> 00:14:45,969
ready for fucking barn - I will look

391
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:48,219
barb back so bad and I'm praying that

392
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,899
barb comes back okay maybe they faked

393
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:51,579
her death maybe that was a fake thing

394
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,349
just to scare the kid you know Twitter

395
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:56,289
user Wendy stone what are you dressing

396
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:58,059
up as this year I like to think that I

397
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,999
will be dressing up a Sweeney Todd but

398
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,069
like a woman version but I also like to

399
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:05,499
think that I might be dressing up as

400
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,970
rogue if I can find costume pieces for

401
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:09,009
that another the tricky part for that

402
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,589
one because I can't just it's a body

403
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:13,449
suit made of rubber like I have to get

404
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,589
that somewhere where a Sweeney Todd I

405
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:15,939

around me like just to keep me company

414
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:37,839

415
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:40,179
a ghost for company no that's not that's

416
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,149
not what this is it's um it would give

417
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:44,799
me assurance that there is some kind of

418
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,079
life after death and I would like that

419
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,359

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,410
people in the internet don't consider

68
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,030
talking to each other one of the

69
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,850
questions I've been asked over and over

70
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,670
is how to know if they reciprocate

71
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,920
feelings and you just use I can ask say

72
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,170
hi do you have feelings for me

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,300
so the fucking higher Jesus Christ I

74
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,570
have more than friendship feelings for

75
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,430
you

76
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,930
I have romantic feelings for you and

77
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,760
it's starting to make me act weird and

78
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,530
read into things so I just wanted to be

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,180
honest and let you know what's going on

80
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,180
in my brain I knew you were being weird

81
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,450
so I just wanted to be honest and let

82
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,070
you know what's going on in my brain

83
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:21,350
thank you so much for being honest with

84
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,880
me I don't have the same feelings but

85
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,140
you're my best friend and I love you so

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,700
much so I just wanted to be honest and

87
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,920
let you know what's going on in my brain

88
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,989
oh my god shut up me too it's been three

89
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,269
years why didn't you say anything in

90
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:39,070
every situation saying how you feel

91
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,600
actually helped you see what I mean

92
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,630
you don't genuinely need more examples

93
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,030
it's just unclear I was also really

94
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,959
surprised to see how many of you said

95
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,390
that you were still trying to make it

96
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,459
work after your friend obviously did not

97
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,780
reciprocate feelings first of all you

98
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,340
can't like force someone to love you I

99
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,630
don't know why you would want to if I

100
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,090
told someone I loved them and they were

101
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,489
like oh I'm not into it I would just be

102
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,570
like okay well if I you obviously have

103
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,670
no taste

104
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,799
second of all trying to force it there

105
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,350
really isn't very of all you do not need

106
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,750
some good-for-nothin no taste

107
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,600
no friend of mine telling you if you are

108
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,729
good enough today you are a prosperous

109
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,700
angel sent from heaven which I don't

110
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:21,230
even believe in but it's true and there

111
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,930
are quite literally two

112
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,400
and 30,000 species of fish in the sea

113
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,410
and way more than one of them is out

114
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,320
there daydreaming about your exact size

115
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,300
booty sense of humor and weird sex nerd

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,740
things that you're into there is no

117
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,240
reason to waste time being in love with

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,280
your best friend who just wants to be

119
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,080
your best friend so I just wanted to be

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,920
honest and let you know what's going on

121
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,330
in my brain Wow

122
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,530
thank you for being honest with me I

123
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,240
don't feel the same way but say that I

124
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,670
know you love your best friend and that

125
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,860
love is based on something very real and

126
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,780
in reality you're not the person that's

127
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,030
going to make them happy so you have to

128
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,380
decide do you want them to be happy or

129
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,990
do you want to make yourself miserable

130
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,370
by trying to force them to love you

131
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,170
which will in turn make them miserable

132
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,450
because you're trying to force them to

133
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,310
love you if there is a self-love Bible

134
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,380
which there should be by the way it

135
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,850
would tell you to stop wasting your time

136
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,920
it would tell you that you're way too

137
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,570
good to be spending all of your energy

138
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,400
on someone who doesn't want to be with

139
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,770
you so how do you move forward an

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,330
ascension so I just wanted to be honest

141
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,630
and let you know what's going on in my

142
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,880
brain

143
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,220
Wow thank you I I don't feel the same

144
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,480
way but our friendship is so important

145
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,190
to me it's okay I knew that was a

146
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,290
possibility I just wanted to be honest

147
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,450
so things didn't keep being weird see

148
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,880
how easy that was and how much lighter

149
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,590
my clone feels by simply saying what she

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,420
was holding is moving forward is going

151
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:43,040
to be hard and weird and different for

152
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,900
everyone but it'll be ultimately where

153
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,310
the best advice I can give you is to

154
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,520
keep being if you're feeling

155
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:51,050
uncomfortable or jealous remove yourself

156
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,610
from the situation maybe take a

157
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,580
friendship ring talk about it with a

158
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,500
friend or a counselor or a family member

159
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,030
that will hear you out but like try not

160
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,290
to be mean disown because the last time

161
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,850
I told someone who's in love with the

162
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,220
best friend who was in a relationship

163
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,660
that maybe she needed to like not see

164
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,050
the person as much she called me an

165
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,970
ignorant bitch so like be real with

166
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,200
yourself and what you can handle some

167
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,840
people can move on quickly

168
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,580
some people might need a minute so I

169
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,110
just wanted to be honest and let you

170
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,790
know what's going on in my brain okay

171
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,360
cool let's cuddle like best friends do

172
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,130
yeah I'm gonna need a minute so here's

173
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
the thing best friends fall in love all

174
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,470
the time they fall in love they get

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,200
married they adopt animals they live in

176
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,260
the woods

177
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,050
they do all the things people in love do

178
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,790
it first starts with them talking about

179
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,590
the fact that they have feelings for

180
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,880
each other why am I still reiterating

181
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,560
this point so you're saying whether it

182
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,200
goes really really really pretty or

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,910
really really really well you have to

184
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,130
say something cause it's going to go

185
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,930
really really really nowhere if you

186
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,300
don't got three options one hold it in

187
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,280
and be weird to you tell them they don't

188
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,080
feel the same way you can move the fuck

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,590
on with your life option number three

190
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,510
you tell them and you might get to bang

191
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,860
just explain it one more time and I just

192
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,990

122,Storybooth Daphne Revealed (Easter Egg),2abdZLRLGSs,"Subscribe: http://bit.ly/sub2storybooth | Thanks to Best Fiends for sponsoring! Download the game for FREE here: http://bit.ly/BestFiends-SB | Comment, like, share this story. Record your story at http://storybooth.com. 

Do you all know who Daphne is? If you've been watching storybooth videos for a little while then chances are you do, or at least you've seen her before. 

Daphne is a young animated actress, with dreams of fame and fortune, and she seems to have made storybooth her platform of choice. She way more than an Easter Egg. She's a social media and youtube Diva. She the Queen of the cameo. The Queen of photobomb. a wannabe youtuber. 

At first it was fine. She auditioned for Ainura K's video, ""Caught Cheating in School,"" and we gave her a decent part - she was Ainura's best friend! But then Daphne kept showing up for auditions, and when she didn't get a part - well - she was obviously mad about it, but there was a certain devilish quality about her. She's very confident. She's also super persistent - relentless actually.

We're not quite sure when it started, and we're not even quite sure how she does it, but Daphne started showing up in episodes where she wasn't given a part. Sometimes in bizarre places.

We knew she was sneaky and not at all afraid to make trouble and try for the spotlight, but we had no idea she would go to such lengths to place herself conveniently into every episode. Let's face it, cameos and photobombs are her thing.  She calls them each a ""guest appearance""...Hilarious! 

When we try to talk to her about it she just shrugs and assures us that one day she'll be famous and then storybooth will be happy to have had so much of her. 

She claims she brings us, and our subscribers and fans good luck. We think that might actually be true - we've had it so far - so we're a little scared to force her out. So you see, she far more that a storybooth Easter Egg. 

Besides, that's just Daphne being Daphne - an unstoppable force!

Can you name all the episodes in this video in the order they show up? Comment them if you can! 

This is a lot of Daphne, but not all of her - the harder to spot the greater the luck, so - good luck!

a little different from the others it is

52
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,989
time and there are so many animals I

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,450
have taken this quiz multiple times but

54
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:19,000
I've got the different animal open every

55
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,640
time but it's usually some form of dog

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,299

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,190

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,790
shower so it's probably that I can do

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,560
all kinds of stuff with it why don't we

72
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,239
get a dantdm look going

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,209
that's always a long way for them this

74
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,910
way that's always a classic hi there we

75
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,340
go oh yeah it's not really doing it

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,989
right now I can sometimes pull off the

77
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,910
dantdm anyways looks like you never ever

78
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,650
will run out of the possibility of

79
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,920
buying a case because if we open eight

80
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,030
oh we're opening an uncommon case click

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,459
case click a case not a case clicker

82
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,989

88
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,780

maybe get a crazy item in here

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,050
potentially what is that what am I about

125
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,970
to get I don't know what this is I don't

equip it of a portrait now could you

133
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,930
support RIT what this is just what I

134
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,930
like that is an item I want that as an

135
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,880
item in game like in in the actual rogue

136
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,660
roblox not just in this game but

137
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,850
although it is very cool

138
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,190
even in this game mode maybe I should

139
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,930
keep it it is worth nothing you are

140
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,910
worth nothing to me

141
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,890
let's open more cases what else do we

142
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,100
got going on here another legendary case

143
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,510
okay because there's some phases in here

144
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,860
that don't seem to be worth all that

145
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:44,260
much but then I feel like this is good I

146
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,250

How to Make a 3D Frog Cake 

Ingredients:
3 Prepared 8” Vanilla Cake layers colored with 
-Layer 1 (5 drops green, 9 drops yellow),
-Layer 3 (2 drops green, 18 drops yellow),
-Layer 4 (2 drops green, 18 drops yellow, 10 drops white)
1 Prepared 9” Vanilla Cake layer (Layer 2) colored with 12 drops green, 9 drops yellow
Prepared vanilla buttercream 
Lime green, white, black, blue, yellow fondant 

Procedure:
1. Roll out white fondant for the eyes and mix with tylose to help harden them faster. Add blue and black for the iris and pupil. Shape the legs (216g) and the arms (91g) with lime green fondant (mixed with tylose). 
2. Prepare cakes according to the recipe, and color the batter according to the drop amounts listed above. 
3. Once cakes have cooled completely, place the darkest one on a cake board, attaching with a swipe of buttercream. Cover that layer with a thin layer of vanilla buttercream. Place the 9” cake on next, cover with buttercream, then the next darkest 8” cake. Finish the stack of cakes, with the lightest green one.
4. To begin carving the cake, start at the top, and gradually shape the cake to be at it’s widest at the 9” cake level, tapered under the 9” level, and then rising up to be smallest at the top. Reserve some of the cake scraps to make cake pop mixture for the vocal sac. 
Attach the vocal sac to the front of the cake. Cover the cake entirely in vanilla buttercream. 
5. Place a ring of fondant around the top of the cake, above the vocal sac. 
6. Roll out fondant, ⅛” in thickness and drape over the cake. 7. Smooth the fondant into place with your hands and a fondant smoother. 
8. Attach the arms, legs and eyes using skewers or spaghetti noodle. 
9. Serve the cake when desired and consume within 2-3 days.","1

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,790
worth of golden diamonds

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,560
let's get started on this tutorial so

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,509
the first thing we have to do is make

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,060
our fondant features because they need a

36
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,860
little bit of time to harden up now in

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,659
order to speed that process up I've

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,000
mixed all of my fondant with a little

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,729
bit of tylose which helps it to solidify

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,610
a little bit faster so here I've got two

41
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,490
white balls of equal size rolled out

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,009
here and I'm just going to take my round

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,170
cutter and I'm going to cut out two blue

44
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,240
pieces and these are going to be the

45
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,920
color on the eyes so I'm just kind of

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,740
neat nning up the side with my finger

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,399
there and then taking a little bit of

48
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,799
water

49
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,409
I just want to wipe that onto the back

50
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,520
and then I'm going to transfer that to

51
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,590
my eyeball and then I'm going to repeat

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,920
that for the second one and I'm also

53
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,710
going to use a smaller cutter and I'm

54
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,840
going to cut a little black ones out for

55
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,720
the pupil and again I'm going to do this

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,530
twice a little bit of little water on

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,860
the back pop that there onto the center

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,170
there

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,700
now newts eyes are a little bit wonky so

60
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,650
you don't have to worry about being too

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,950
precise with the eyes and then I'm just

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:26,130
taking a really tiny piece of white

63
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,420
fondant and I'm just attaching that it's

64
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,120
super tricky there we go

65
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,940
attaching that there as the highlight so

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,570
I'll repeat that for a second I now also

67
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,630
for the frog arms and the frog legs

68
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,290
we're going to be using basically a lime

69
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,540
green fondant also again I've mixed it

70
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,240
with tylose you want to really work this

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,280
fondant in order to get everything mixed

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,770
together if you mix the color you can

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,590
make lime green with a yellow and green

74
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,810
I'm just taking my finger here and I'm

75
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,030
kind of partitioning a little bit of the

76
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,100
bottom here and that's where my fingers

77
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,709
are going to go for the webbed part for

78
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,660
the Frog and then I'm just bending it in

79
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,880
like this I'm going to flatten this

80
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,040
corner over here and this is the part

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,500
that's going to touch the Frog right

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,560
there kind of curving that like that

83
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,200
then I'm going to take a knife and I'm

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,720
going to slice into this part that I

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,730
laid out before and then we're going to

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,269
take my roller I'm just going to roll

87
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,980
down to flatten these ones out now to

88
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,200
make this one a little bit more pointed

89
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,160
you can take your sharp knife again and

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,160
you can do that for all of the little

91
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,100
pieces here of the we'll call them the

92
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,739
Frog CIGNA's so it's going to play with

93
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,320
that with my fingers and then stretch

94
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,510
that one out like that using a fondant

95
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,209
tool we can just work those little

96
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,800
divots together better and then using

97
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,269
the ball tool again I'm just going to

98
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,250
press down into this area like this so

99
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,200
it's kind of marking those now these are

100
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,910
going to need to harden completely so

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,830
we're going to press or just set that

102
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:11,070
aside there and then I am using 216

103
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,170
grams of lime green fondant for the leg

104
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:16,109
now the leg is a little bit trickier to

105
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,419
make but what we're going to do is just

106
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,580
roll out this fondant so I'm going to

107
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,620
right on that cut line there I'm going

108
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,270
to press my finger into that and then

109
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,760
about half way through I'm going to

110
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,950
press my finger down to there

111
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,110
so I've got two little divots because

112
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,230
I'm basically creating the joints in the

113
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,300
leg like this then I want this to be

114
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,060
smaller so I'm going to roll that all

115
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,790
out I've still got my joints here now

116
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,280
we're going to position the leg so here

117
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,230
we Bend that part up then there so

118
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,780
that's like the knee and we've got that

119
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,370
flattened out like that so you've got

120
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,580
your little leg standing up here like

121
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,010
this take the roller roll it out and

122
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:59,720
then we're going to cut it just like we

123
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:03,500
did with the hand taking my knife and I

124
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,900
cut into there cut into there trim out a

125
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,660
little bit and then we're going to do

126
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,720
the same kind of little details on a Z

127
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,660
basically the little toes here work that

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,840
in roll that out and I clean it up with

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,650
your fingers and then just add a little

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,180
bit of detail and let this dry as well

131
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:27,020
so now we're going to shape our cake

132
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,720
what I've got here is 3/8 inch round

133
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,120
cakes and I'm putting a layer of

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,880
buttercream in between each of them and

135
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,550
I have one 9-inch round cake

136
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,490
so this first cake at the bottom here is

137
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,800
the darkest version of green that I

138
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,680
created now if you want to know the

139
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,930
exact amount of green and yellow that I

140
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,520
use to make each of these colors of cake

141
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,610
make sure you check out the description

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,580
box for that amount egde so here I've

143
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,800
got the 9-inch one going on a second so

144
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,630
I'm going to put on some buttercream

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,670
here you don't have to go all the way to

146
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,100
the edge of this one because we will be

147
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,620
doing some trimming of this one but you

148
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:10,100
can spread it out and then I'm going to

149
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,750
stack my next two greens and their

150
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,720
difference between them all the greens

151
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,730
is is very subtle I just wanted that

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,640
little bit of an ombre effect on the

153
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,590
inside of Newt so our next one is going

154
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,380
up here this is an 8-inch round one

155
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:26,660
again and then we're going to finish off

156
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,670
our stack with a little bit more

157
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,950
buttercream and then we're going to

158
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,260
start carving so we're going to be

159
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:36,350
carving Newt starting at the top which

160
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:39,680
will be the narrowest and then working

161
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:42,199
our way down to the widest part

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,530
to be the 9-inch round so to do that I'm

163
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,139
just taking a just a sharp knife and I'm

164
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,750
going to start carving just at the top

165
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:52,400
here because it's the easiest part so

166
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,550
we're just going to go around and as I

167
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,570
work my way around the cake and

168
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,919
downwards I'm just going to make sure

169
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,380
that I don't have any of these sharp

170
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,280
edges left and that everything is nice

171
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,410
and smooth got my cake cut here I'm

172
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,620
going to take some more vanilla

173
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,100
buttercream and I'm going to smooth it

174
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,710
on just this part here to start with I

175
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,979
kept my crumbs and I turned my crumbs

176
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,340
into cake pop mixture so right here at

177
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:25,610
the front I'm going to put the vocal

178
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:28,190
sack for Newt at the front made out of

179
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,590
cake pop mixture so just kind of like

180
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,380
shape to piece here and you just want to

181
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,810
press it on pretty much you can put it

182
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,270
anywhere you want to there now if you're

183
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,090
having trouble with that sticking you

184
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,460
could always use pieces of spaghetti in

185
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,110
order to help get those in there so it

186
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,000
stays solid mine's kind of hanging out

187
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,979
there pretty easily so I'm just going to

188
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,590
leave it like that actually I might put

189
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,650
one just for safe measure over here so

190
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,659
like that and now with that in place I

191
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,419
can cover everything in my vanilla

192
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:01,639
buttercream including going over top of

193
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,590
the throat back cakes covered in

194
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,440
buttercream now we're going to wrap

195
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,199
around a piece of fondant that I just

196
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,210
rolled out and I've got one side flat

197
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,370
and I'm basically just attaching it to

198
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,740
the cake so I've got a little place to

199
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,300
like indent the mouth underneath above

200
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,820
underneath this little part and then

201
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,260
above the throat sack so just going to

202
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,050
set it on there you want to put this on

203
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,740
there first before you cover the cake in

204
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,530
fondant

205
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,620
so I've rolled out the fondant here on a

206
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,330
silicone mat and it's about a but an

207
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,130
eighth of an inch in thickness so I'm

208
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,250
just going to pick up my mat and drape

209
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,469
it over top of my cake I just find that

210
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,630
this is the easiest way to do that kind

211
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,310
of how I learned and that's what I'm

212
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,580
most comfortable with and we just peel

213
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:49,370
back the fondant match and then we've

214
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,589
got a fondant covered cake so then we

215
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,480
just want to start at the top you can

216
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:55,040
use a fondant smoother 4p

217
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,960
says I like to start out just with my

218
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,140
fingers kind of gently working it down

219
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,510
towards the bum I've got all of my

220
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,090
pieces here that we need to put the cake

221
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,740
together on the board now one of the

222
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,280
final things we have to do with fondant

223
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,100
here on underneath the throat sack is

224
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,310
I've just cut out a piece of almost like

225
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,230
a really really golden yellow or almost

226
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,530
like a light orange I'm just going to

227
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,720
slide that under there and that's a

228
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,580
great spot to for hiding any wrinkles

229
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,890
that you had in your fondant because

230
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,720
going over top of the throat sack is a

231
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,610
little bit tricky sometimes so that's

232
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,640
kind of nice to have that little piece

233
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,460
to cover up any mistakes there so now

234
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,040
coming over back to my board what I want

235
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,140
to do is put on some final touches on

236
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,210
the eye but I've just got little rounds

237
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,000
cut out here and I'm just going to wrap

238
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:49,820
this around the flat part as the eyeball

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,100
sits and driving hardens it there's a

240
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,230
like a basically a flat edge to it where

241
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,760
it's not round and that's the part that

242
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,070
I'm covering and that's the part that's

243
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,810
going to sit against the cake it kind of

244
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,000
comes in handy to have that little flat

245
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,550
bit and then because I'm going to be

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,430
using spaghetti I need to drill

247
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,130
basically a pilot hole into the eyes and

248
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,260
the legs and the arms and I'm just going

249
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,330
to take like a sharp tool here and I'm

250
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,620
just going to press that in and that's

251
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,650
just going to make sure that the

252
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,080
spaghetti doesn't break when it goes in

253
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:23,060
so then I can take a piece of spaghetti

254
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,980
break off that part and then just make

255
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,170
sure that it's going to work in there

256
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,670
and that works perfectly so when I go to

257
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,970
put that into the cake I'll be able to

258
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,760
poke that in quite easily final things

259
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,700
we need to do is I've just been shining

260
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:41,090
up the vocal sack here I'm just using a

261
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,710
little bit of water with a sponge what

262
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,750
that's going to do is just basically

263
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,220
highlight that so that when light hits

264
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,140
it is going to look a little bit

265
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,610
brighter than the rest of the cake water

266
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,100
gives fun than a nice little shine

267
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,800
whether you wanted to or not here I'm

268
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,160
putting on my eye balls I've got the

269
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,050
spaghetti that's laid into the pieces

270
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,810
here you can arrange them it's nice they

271
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,490
turn around then over here I've got the

272
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,920
spots for the legs and the arm so it's

273
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,020
set the leg up there beside it and then

274
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,320
for the arm in there I'm just going to

275
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,660
press or press my little guide hole that

276
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,180
I've sent that I drilled in there to

277
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,380
begin with on to the side there if you

278
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,270
want to put a little bit of water

279
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,790
underneath there you can to help the

280
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,339
sticking now until it dries in place

281
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,290
excuse me legs I'm going to put just a

282
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:30,330
little bit of paper towel there you

283
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,370
could use foam as well if that's easier

284
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,839
for you you also might want to use

285
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,459
something a little bit thicker than the

286
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,740
spaghetti or a couple pieces of

287
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,570
spaghetti like a wood skewer or a

288
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,700
lollipop stick so I'm going to finish

289
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,810
putting this all together and I'll show

290
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,380

design today for this a 3d frog cake now

293
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,420
to finish off the cake what I did is I

294
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,910
spliced into it so you guys could see

295
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,339
the ombre layers on the inside and then

296
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,500
I shaped my cake board like a lily pad

297
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,510
so I just cut a chunk out of the front

298
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,839
there and then I wrapped it in some

299
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,700

thank you what's up guys so today we

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,819
have a little bit different video for

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,859
you we are going to talk about the

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,080
different ways we make money to afford

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,630
to travel yes a lot of you guys always

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,130
ask how we afford to travel like because

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,680
we see each other every three months and

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,230
now usually plane tickets are not cheap

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,210
so a lot of you guys always ask like how

10
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,400
do you do it so we decided to make this

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,689
video for you look get right into it the

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,340
first way is YouTube

13
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,189
we don't make a ton of money off youtube

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,140
yet but we do enjoy it and the little

15
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,850

stuff online I I created a little store

38
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,350
online there's this website in Brazil

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,330
it's called anyway if you want to buy my

40
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,780
stuff the links down below plug book

41
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:33,450
book book if you want to help us but yes

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,979
I have a store online where where I got

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,650
all my old clothes that isn't news

44
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,720
anymore and now everything is on a store

45
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,299
and I got my mom so it's doing also nice

46
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,880
ass or pops online but she would kill me

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,930
still your brother and sister stuff and

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,750
tell about all I know

49
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,030
Oh what yes so yeah if your brothers and

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,270
sisters have anything valuable that they

51
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,219
collect sell those we're kidding by the

52
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,590
way but we are not responsible for any

53
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,000
family problems this may cause yeah but

54
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,170
that that's more of arias thing I don't

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,030
so too much of my stuff yeah and I don't

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,360
really have a lot of old stuff to sell

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,979
maybe some clothes but I

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,860
get much money from that so that's more

59
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,810
of our thing but it is definitely a good

60
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,330
option if you have some valuable stuff

61
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,310
to sell so I recommend yours and also

62
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,990
we're going to school to college or

63
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,330
whatever just sell food there because

64
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,970
everybody likes food so it could tell

65
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,410
like anything that is good to eat people

66
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,140
are going to buy it so that's a good

67
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,090
thing to do to a lot of people give me

68
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,140
advice on doing that but I don't go to

69
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,810
school right now I'm going to start

70
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,640
school in July so so once once you start

71
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,620
school maybe you'll do that alright so

72
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
another really good way to save money is

73
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,190
cut out unnecessary things from from

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,350
your day-to-day spending so for example

75
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:50,250
I used to buy my lunch at work every

76
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,510
single day I would go to Chipotle or a

77
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,600
grocery store somewhere and it would be

78
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:58,840
six to ten dollars maybe more depending

79
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,580
on where I went and just switching from

80
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,150
doing that in to making my food every

81
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,250
day saved me a ton of money so that that

82
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,020
simple thing alone will save you a lot

83
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,030
and then you can do things like not

84
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,190
going out as much like even when you go

85
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,920
to the grocery store you might get a

86
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,080
bunch of unnecessary stuff that you

87
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,760
don't eat and then it goes bad like try

88
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,010
to think while your wife shall they need

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,630
before you buy it and if you're used to

90
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,360
go out with your friends every single

91
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,209
weekend try to stop doing that and go

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,580
like just one weekend a month or so like

93
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,560
just try to cut out stuff that you don't

94
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,330
need yeah this one I know it sounds

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
simple like save money is basically what

96
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,720
we're saying but when you look at these

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,370
little things a lot of times you don't

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,799
see how or realize how much you're

99
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,570
actually spending in a day that that is

100
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,280
completely unnecessary and you can save

101
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,450
a lot and then it just kind of comes

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,510
down to what's more important to you

103
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,860
saving money so you can travel or

104
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,930
spending more money on food everyday or

105
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,030
whatever it is so your choice and then a

106
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,100
good thing that you can do is look for

107
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,989
the cheapest fling tickets we have some

108
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,730
tips on bass but we think that the video

109
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:03,040
would be too long if we put that in here

110
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,170
so if you want we'll do another video on

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,930
that another thing you can use your

112
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,700
talents to sell or teach or do something

113
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,769
with people like I'm teaching English

114
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,980
right now like I do conversation classes

115
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,239
with people online and that's helping a

116
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,190
lot because like a lot of people are

117
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,650
interested in

118
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,600
learn English obviously so that's really

119
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,480
good and if you want classes when they

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,250
just let me know email me I think this

121
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,990
is a really good one because you can

122
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,000
usually what you're good at is something

123
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,920
you're passionate about for our you

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,920
might have some skill like like English

125
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,420
or video editing if she loves and she's

126
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,260
good at people will pay for services

127
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,730
like that myself I could I could give

128
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,700
singing lessons to people it's something

129
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,620
I like something I'm good at computer

130
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,000

service and doesn't know how to do it

134
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,930
and you can make money doing that

135
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,690
alright guys so that is the main few

136
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,580
ways that we can think of that maybe you

137
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,050
hadn't thought of or it would inspire

138
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,240
you to go out and do something and it's

139
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,300
also the ways that we have actually used

to make money to travel and and can

141
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,260

00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:08,320
Hey guys it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,969
I have been playing a lot of app games lately
and you guys know me, I love games

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:18,420
with food in them. And, I’ve fallen in love
with one recently called Farm Heroes.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,339
They just came out with their new game Farm
Heroes Super Saga,

5
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:25,300
I really enjoyed playing this game and worked
with King Games who supported

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,560
this video to make some treats today. For those
of you who might not be

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,290
familiar with Farm Heroes, it’s a farming
themed match game, it’s very fun

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,630
and easy to play. You need to match 3 Cropsies
to collect them and put them

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,130
in your crate. And, if you get 4 Cropsies
in a 4 square, they become

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,190
Super Cropsies, and in this case bigger is
better!

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,000
You can also get more points this way.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,420
So in honor of the new game, today we are
gonna be making Cropsie Themed Cookies.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,870
Let’s get started!

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,210
The recipe that we’re gonna be making today
is a vanilla almond homemade cookie

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,010
recipe, this one is from the Nerdy Nummies
Cookbook.

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,160
The things you will need, will be: 3 Cups
of all purpose flour, 3/4 cup of

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,260
almond meal, 1-1/2 cups of sugar, 2 sticks
of salted butter at room temperature,

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,440
1/8 a teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of baking
powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of ground

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,600
nutmeg, 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract,
1-1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract,

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,750
and 2 eggs. Then you will also need some different
cookie cutters for the

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,930
Cropsie Characters. In the game they are so
cute! Over here I’ve got a water

22
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,650
drop cookie cutter, a plum, banana, pear,
carrot… I think this one was

23
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,180
technically a strawberry, but it looks just
fine as a carrot!

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,190
And, a little tomato. Now let’s put it all
together!

25
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,530
The first thing that we’re gonna do in a
medium bowl, we are gonna whisk

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,510
together our dry ingredients, flour, almond
meal, salty-salty, baking powder

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,729
and nutmeg. Then whisk together until well
combined and then we’re gonna set

28
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,010
it off to the side.

29
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,920
Next, in a large mixing bowl we are gonna
cream together our butter and sugar.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,190
We are gonna mix together until everything
is light and fluffy.

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,660
Now we are gonna mix in our eggs 1 at a time.

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,360
Add your first egg, mix it up, then scrape
down the sides, add your second

33
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,989
egg, mix it up, and scrape down the sides.

34
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:14,340
After we have mixed in our eggs we are going
to add both of our extracts,

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,280
vanilla and almond, then mix together until
well combined.

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,260
Everything is mixed together and now we are
gonna add our dry ingredients

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,370
to our butter mixture, I’m gonna be adding
it 1/2 at a time so that it

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,269
won’t create a big dust cloud. Mix together,
then scrape down the sides

39
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,180
then pour the other 1/2 in, mix together and
scrape down the sides.

40
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:39,239
Mmmmm! Our cookie dough is now ready, I’ve
divided it into 2 parts, we are

41
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,260
gonna shape the dough into 2 discs and wrap
them up with food safe plastic wrap

42
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,409
and then pop these in the fridge for about
1 hour to chill.

43
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:52,240
Our dough is ready, it has chilled in the
fridge, and now we are gonna roll it out.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,419
And I’ve got it right here, we’ve gotta
unwrap it and I’m gonna do a little bit

45
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,609
of what I call baking flair.

46
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,999
Just grab it like this, and give it a tug!

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,599
We’re gonna take a little pinch of flour,
sprinkle it down on top of the surface

48
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,189
so that the dough won’t stick. Put a little
flour on top, a little flour

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,219
on my rolling pin. And then I’m gonna roll
it out about 1/4 inch thick.

50
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:16,639
Alright, this is looking good, I’ve got
all the cookie cutters over here,

51
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,279
and we’re gonna cut out as many as you can.
I’m gonna start with the little plum.

52
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,969
I’m gonna place it right here on top of
a baking sheet lined with a piece

53
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:29,169
of parchment paper. Then I’ll do a little
carrot, a tomato. There’s plenty

54
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,079
of cookie dough to make many of these little
Cropsies, but I’m just placing

55
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,329
6 Cropsies on each baking sheet so that they
have plenty of room.

56
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,379
After you have your cookies on your baking
sheet you’re gonna pop these into

57
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,010
the freezer for 10 minutes to set, and then
we’re gonna bake them.

58
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,790
You’re gonna heat your oven to 350 degrees
and bake for about 12-13 minutes.

59
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,569
Once your cookies have baked and had plenty
of time to cool, now it’s time

60
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,879
to decorate. Over here I’ve got a bunch
of royal icing in different

61
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,299
plastic baggies, with tips at the end for
a little bit more design control.

62
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,129
The colors that I dyed the royal icing are
red, orange, yellow, green, blue,

63
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,359
purple, white, light brown and this is very
dark brown.

64
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,349
Over here on this cutting board, I’ve got
1 of each type of Cropsie Cookie.

65
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,580
And the first thing that we’re gonna do
is pipe an outline.

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,340
So I’m gonna start with blue and we’re
gonna do the little water drop

67
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,099
character. Just pipe an outline all the way
around.

68
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,530
Then we're gonna pipe outlines on each of our cookies
using the correct colors.

69
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,120
On some of the fruits and vegetables, I’m
not gonna pipe the stems.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,520
Once your cookies are outlined, I’ve let
them sit out for just a few minutes,

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,919
so that the outline layer of royal icing hardens
a little bit, so it will

72
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,960
hold shape. Now we’re gonna fill them in,
which in the baking world is

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,009
called flooding. I like to make zig-zags,
back and forth, back and forth

74
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:53,240
and then using a toothpick, moving the icing
around so that it’s all touching,

75
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,930
all connecting. Then we’re gonna fill in
the rest of our cookies, continuing

76
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,500
to match the colors. After you’ve filled
in all the cookies, again you’re gonna

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,199
want to let them set for a few minutes, I
like to take my finger and gently

78
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,770
touch the top, and if I feel that it’s hardened
and dry, I know I can decorate

79
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,710
some more! Now I’m gonna take my white royal
icing, I’m gonna pipe all of their

80
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,900
little eyeballs. All of the eyeballs for the
different Cropsie characters are

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,750
different, so I’m just looking on my phone
and trying to match what they look like.

82
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,430
Time for more decoration details on the eyes.
We are gonna be piping iris’ and

83
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,310
the pupils on each little character.

84
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,080
It’s just good to note that their iris is
gonna be the same color as their body.

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,060
Lastly I’m just taking a little white royal
icing and I’m just putting a little

86
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
dot on each eyeball.

87
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,640
These are so cute, they’re really starting
to look like the Cropsies, look,

88
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,120
look at that little face! Aw!

89
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,639
But, they’re not done yet we have a few
more details. Again, using the dark brown,

90
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,560
I’m gonna pipe a line on top of each eyelid,
just giving it a little bit more

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,500
personality and definition. And our little
plum gets some eyelashes!

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,720
Oooh-oooh-oooh!

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,580
These are starting to look adorable! We just
finished the eyes, now we are going

94
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,960
to decorate the mouth. All of our characters
are going to get a light brown

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,979
mouth, with a top line of dark brown for definition.

96
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,580
And some of the characters will get a little
white royal icing, for their teeth!

97
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,770
Final decoration step is we are going to ice
the little stems on all the

98
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,860
Cropsies characters. Remember, the water does
not have a stem, and the pear is

99
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,360
the only one that we are gonna be icing brown.

100
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,960
But the rest of them are all green!

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,920
Ta-da! Here are the Cropsie Themed Cookies,
from the new game

102
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,759
Farm Heroes Super Saga, that we made today!

103
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,740
Each little Cropsie has it’s own personality,
the 2 that are my favorite, that

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,419
I think I’m the most like, are the pear
and the banana!

105
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:51,699
The banana is excitable and a little bit crazy,
and the pear is sassy, feisty

106
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:56,259
and kind. If you guys play the game, let me
know in the comments down below which

107
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,909
little Cropsie personality you are most like.
Maybe you’re like the carrot,

108
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,110
who’s confident, cheeky, ah-hee-hee-hee!
And happy!

109
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,439
I’ll be taking lots of pictures of these
cookies and posting them on Facebook,

110
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,490

other youtuber ever the reason why these

guys are actually such a great sponsor

34
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,299
and why so many people do it is because

35
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,640
they actually want your real honest

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,530
opinion so silliness aside my honest

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,560
opinion is that it surprisingly a really

38
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,229
good game and it's rather there so now

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,659
that the required part is over time to

40
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,820
draw you guys I actually went to

41
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,829
Instagram cause it was instagrams turn

42
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,079

43
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,320

use the hashtag draw me crystal and now

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,880
is the moment for me to

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,860
I kneel I'll ask as a nerd you are my

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,630
first victim I could just be the red and

50
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,370
black so I come on to me seems like holy

51
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,600
fuck

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,240
so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,490
make you insulated and for those of you

54
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,709
who are going to inevitably ask I am

55
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,709
drawing in Adobe Illustrator

56
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,050
I get that question itself so that's

57
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,060
what I use this is not gonna look

58
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,739
exactly like the screen style because I

59
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:42,310
am not super good at mimicking styles

60
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:45,310
I'll try but this is going to be way

61
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,700
more cute even when I try really hard to

62
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:55,480
not be cute pages it comes out that way

63
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:57,550
like your response haircut another eyes

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,130
I know I had chosen like that silent try

65
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:06,130
something their eyes are way more round

66
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,980
II expertly what I'm looking at I just

67
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,980
like relook at the best scenes

68
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,050
characters bars a lot more round

69
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,050
[Music]

70
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,040
let me go back

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,870
eyeliner situation going to like the

72
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:31,950
other eyes the little slips they're

73
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,980
close to my style but I think these are

74
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,980
capturing it you're like rakesh essence

75
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,110
a little more and it's also a little bit

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,500
closer to the best scene style do I

77
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,970
think it would be you I think I like

78
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,410
that I got a volatile area but I would

79
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,570
just take way more time and I have to

80
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,440
want to be in like three hours

81
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,960
absolutely but like that's like you get

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,070
those meatballs I can you guys make this

83
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,950

84
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,500
every single time together also

85
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,110

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:33,990
Roundy type eyes they also like

95
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:37,040
incorporate the mouth like into the head

96
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,040
if that makes any sense

97
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,260
even really big small intimate week

98
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:51,030

99
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:56,190

100
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,440

side

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,290

Ellie is cleaning me and we took Jax in

10
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:52,540
the preschool and I've been working on a

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,570
video for Ellie channel 2 actually just

12
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,480
went live but sometimes I get a little

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,270
distracted so a while ago I tweeted out

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,489
that I finally passed like the most

15
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,289
difficult level on best beams I think it

16
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,149
was like level 64 or something like that

17
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:10,539
and a bunch of you guys tweeted me back

18
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:14,140
saying like dude Jared your level 64

19
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:19,259
I'm on level 100 I'm on level 250 and

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,479
then someone even said I won level 592 I

21
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,910
I can't even believe that that's amazing

22
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:30,220
I passable 64 and I was just like who's

23
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:37,360
finally like insert gift that explains

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:40,509
my feeling I've been kind of competing

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,090
with Jeff from Johnson Sam and last I

26
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:46,599
heard he was on level 71 I'm happy to

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,849
report that I am on level 72 I've got to

28
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:50,979
be Jeff Jeff or Natalia I'm not sure

29
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:53,530
who's doing the playing here actually

30
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,929
let's be honest I think Natalia is the

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,759
one behind all of the success on their

32
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:00,220
best fiends account and you guys didn't

33
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,140
already know what best beans was it's

34
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,060
actually a free puzzle adventure game

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,849
where you collect and build a team of

36
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,310
things to defeat slugs by matching the

37
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:12,250
same colored object and you beat up this

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,950

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,680

musically talented I can tell

122
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:40,310
I don't know what it is about being

123
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,870
productive but it's like it's almost

124
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,610
like contagious and you want to just

125
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,440
keep doing more and more and more so we

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,060
just filmed a video for Ellie's Channel

127
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,430
and that was a lot of fun it was

128
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,770
actually kind of more surprising and

129
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,720
sporadic than anything but we've got

130
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,700
that productive juices flowing in our

131
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,140
body and we were supposed to do this a

132
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,060
little while ago but we're going to hang

133
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,090
these little shelves up hands off remove

134
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,400
it like that I usually place to test dot

135
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,310
Bullock thank you told me about self

136
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,480
that's right I liked it yeah so we're

137
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,100
going to hang these shelves and we're

138
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,580
going to put them just right above the

139
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,820
toilet

140
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,560
I just hate me first drill like those

141
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,980
the first one always makes it all

142
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,050
nervous

143
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:22,060
slower cringe ready so what's fun is is

144
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,060
our house you can do a lot Oh

145
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:34,919
they haul it looks great

146
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:37,049
don't forget the stickers to cover up

147
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,429
the nail holes from rule that's the

148
00:06:37,049 --> 00:06:40,109
worst you don't want that

149
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:42,899
that's one probably the most important

150
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:45,929
part in this whole project perfect so

151
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,629
this was my mom's that she gave to my

152
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:51,539
grandma and then that was my grandma's

153
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:55,349
she painted and then this is my mom's

154
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,389
died broke one time is a kid and Julie

155
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,039
was like if you don't tell mom I am and

156
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,899
she's going to get mad at you and I

157
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,449
remember crying and telling my mom and

158
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,939
she was like it's okay and made me feel

159
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,409
really cute so she gave that to me need

160
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,669
to get some things to come out of this

161
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:13,169

If you're reading THIS, comment below with what YOUR favorite game is on your phone - that's how I'll know you read this far... ;] Huge thanks to everyone who made this video possible - y'all for getting the paperback version of BINGE, Best Fiends for sponsoring this video (all opinions are my own, obvi), Moonlight for being my favorite movie so far this year (IT'S SO GOOD), and y'all for always Tumbling about my videos when they come out! :]","1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
hey everyone my name is Tyler Oakley and

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,819
I recently asked you guys to send some

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,210
questions with the hashtag ask Tyler

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,320
anything yeah no that was very Lady Gaga

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,940
with me but here we go

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,670
Donna says what does it feel like to be

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,770
famous Donna I think this question as a

8
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,300
trap because to answer is to imply that

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,640
I think I'm famous which a lot of people

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,039
would have liked argue with so I'll only

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,810
talk to my experience it's very weird to

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,340
have people know who I am and may not

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,410
know who they are it's very weird to

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,570
have people have opinions of me that

15
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,329
I've never met or heard of the weirdest

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,340
thing is to walk a red carpet okay I

17
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,090
think it perfectly encapsulates the

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,270
whole weirdness of Fame because it's so

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:46,739
fake it's so weird it's so stupid and so

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,539
like produced like you are standing on a

21
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,940
carpet smiling in an outfit that you

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,129
didn't pick for an event then you

23
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,920
probably would rather stay home instead

24
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,660
of going to and you're smiling at these

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,890
strangers were screaming your name to

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,690
take a picture of you to put on a

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,350
website so that the website gets clicks

28
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,570
when you think about it all it's just it

29
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,479
is a circus there are a lot of things

30
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,049
surrounding Fame that I enjoy I like

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,000
having a voice that is heard and being

32
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,470
conscious of what I'm saying and

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,119
hopefully trying to do put in the world

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,850
that is a cool thing of Fame but the

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,159
circus of Fame is an eye-roll and a half

36
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,640
it's silly and weird and fun and

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,000
stressful and it's a job that's what it

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,979
is

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,960
it's a job nobody ever says it's just a

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,750
job because everyone from the outside of

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,159
things inside this thing but at the end

42
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,509
of the day it's a job I hope that

43
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,799
doesn't come across like I don't like it

44
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,810
I just don't try to explain it I'm

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,850
trying like it's weird to even think

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,490
about I don't know does that make sense

47
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,960
who I should ask my friends about this

48
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,520
more because I think it's so interesting

49
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,990
and I think it's something that none of

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,939
us talk about should I drop out of

51
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,790

comments below cuz I'm having a ton of

29
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,840
fun playing it but now on to the video

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,399
for today's top 10 I decided to do

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,110
something a bit different

32
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:17,640
there's some Pokemon in the Pokemon

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,979
world that are really cute that you want

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,270
to just snuggle up to and hug and there

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,520
are others that are really cool-looking

36
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,340
that you'd want to ride gloriously into

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
battle with however there are others in

38
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,180
the Pokemon world that you wouldn't want

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,920
to touch with a ten-foot pole so today

40
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,619
I'm gonna be talking about those Pokemon

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,359
by counting down the top 10 most

42
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,979
disgusting Pokemon now I do want to say

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,140
that just because a Pokemon is on this

44
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,000
list doesn't mean that I dislike it

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,579
several these Pokemon I actually like a

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,420
lot as drawings or images on a screen

47
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,969
but in real life I probably would not

48
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,890
want to touch them or maybe not even

49
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,479
look at too hard so be sure to leave a

50
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,490
like and subscribe if you haven't and

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,700
without further ado here are the top 10

52
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,320
most disgusting Pokemon number 10

53
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,850
coughing and wheezing I put both

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
coughing and wheezing in this spot

55
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,410
because they're both here for the same

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,120
reason their gas coughing and wheezing

57
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,349
are germs shaped balloons that are

58
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,060
filled with nothing but toxic

59
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,910
foul-smelling gases that have the

60
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,750
potential to explode they're essentially

61
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,150
fart bombs which is gross

62
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,010
now while stinky gases are gross I

63
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,270
personally decided to keep coughing and

64
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,970
wheezing lower on this list because

65
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,590
while foul gases aren't pleasant there

66
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,230
are other substances out there that are

67
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,840
much more nauseating and unpleasant to

68
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,880
deal with in simpler terms farts can be

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,580
funny and most of the other things that

70
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:48,819
these other pokemon create or do are not

71
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:51,280
number 9 latias just kidding number 9

72
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,260
licky licky remember how I said that I

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,920
didn't necessarily dislike the Pokemon

74
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,620
on this list

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:02,380
well I dislike licky licky a lot back in

76
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,090
my top 5 worst original 151 Pokemon

77
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,370
video I talked about how lick a tongue

78
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,190
is a really poor design that's also

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,890
pretty uncomfortable and licky licky is

80
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,110
just an advanced version of that however

81
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,420
what makes licky licky gross isn't the

82
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,459
fact that it has a stupid design it's

83
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,400
the fact that it has a giant tongue

84
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,730
hanging out all the time that gets drool

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,040
in saliva everywhere I personally am NOT

86
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,989
a fan of super slobbery dogs licking me

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,660
in the face and licky licky would be

88
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,150
five times worse than that and make me

89
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,250
numb licky licky isn't that high on this

90
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,859
list though because after all humans

91
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,660
exchanged spit on a regular basis but I

92
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:43,900
still don't want to get anywhere near

93
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,549
one number eight Galvin Sheila

94
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,500
admittedly if there was a cockroach

95
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,720
Pokemon it would be in this spot on this

96
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,090
list but since there's not a spider is

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,639
next up because spiders are still really

98
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,489
gross and unsettling and since galvan

99
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,410
Sheila is a giant yellow one it makes it

100
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,209
so much worse than a regular spider

101
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,709
could you imagine waking up in the

102
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,989
middle of the night to see this thing

103
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,690
crawling around your room no way man

104
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,130
that is terrifying and nasty also I

105
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,260
should mention that I chose gallivant

106
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,180
Sheila over ariados here simply because

107
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,639
I think hairy spiders are grosser than

108
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,000
non hairy spiders the non hairy ones are

109
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:20,739
just plain terrified number seven

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,020
sliggoo I've said before that middle

111
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,909
evolutions are oftentimes the awkward

112
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,570
puberty stage of a Pokemon throughout

113
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:30,240
its lifespan being halfway between cute

114
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,760
badass sliggoo is a prime example of

115
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,980
this Guney is a cute little blob and

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,070
goodra is a cute yet strong looking

117
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,130
dragon slug thing sliggoo however just

118
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,810
looks goofy and pretty gross but what

119
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,970
makes sliggoo gross isn't due to the

120
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,340
fact that it looks gross but it's the

121
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,950
fact that it is constantly secreting and

122
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,540
covered in slime everywhere this thing

123
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,180
goes it leaves a trail of slime that

124
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,220
just gets everywhere and it seems to

125
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,560
have less control over its oozing than

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,600
its other evolutions if you got anywhere

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,690
near a sliggoo you'd probably end up

128
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,240
covered in slime that can supposedly

129
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,950
dissolve anything imagine being in an

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,410
area that a sliggoo has slithered all

131
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,700
over with everything covered in slime in

132
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,820
half dissolved

133
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:19,940
that's disgusting number 6

134
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,940
skunk tank first off look at this sprite

135
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,470
that's weird

136
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:27,450
and pretty gross but that weird sprite

137
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,970
isn't the only gross thing about scum

138
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,710
tank being based off of skunks scum tank

139
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,690
can shoot a foul-smelling liquid from

140
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,330
the tip of its tail and it can shoot

141
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,210
that liquid up to a hundred and sixty

142
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,100
feet obviously the liquid itself is

143
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,500
pretty gross but the fact that it can

144
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,690
shoot that liquid in such a large radius

145
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,670
means that once gun tank could leave an

146
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,220
area of land that's pretty sizable

147
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,680
completely uninhabitable for quite some

148
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,760
time simply because the stench is just

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,710
too disgusting number five victreebel at

150
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,110
first glance viktor belt isn't

151
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,120
particularly repulsive it's just an

152
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,730
intense looking pitcher plant with leafy

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
hands and angry eyes but what makes

154
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,980
victreebel truly disgusting is what you

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,080
can't see just from glancing at it

156
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:17,250
victreebel swallows its prey hole and

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,430
melts it bones and all obviously that's

158
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,900
pretty gross but what makes victreebel

159
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,000
exceptionally disgusting is the fact

160
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,520
that if you just peer over the top of it

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,280
you can look in and see its partially

162
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,960
digested pray just sloshing around I

163
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,550
don't even want to think about what that

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,840
would look like because I know it would

165
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,000
be horrifyingly disgusting number 4 cray

166
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,590
dilly remember how I was just talking

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,790
about how you can just peer over the top

168
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,440
of

169
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,960
victreebel and look in and see it

170
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,550
sparsely digested prey well it turns out

171
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,320
that Craig dilly and victreebel actually

172
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,390
have a lot in common since both are

173
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,340
grass type Pokemon that melt their prey

174
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,440
but Craig dilly is a step up from

175
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,300
victreebel on the disgusting meter

176
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,370
because Craig dilly doesn't do its

177
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,010
digesting inside a pitcher that you can

178
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,800
only see into on the top Cray dilly

179
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:07,060
actually secretes digestive fluids from

180
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,580
its phallic tentacles and melts its prey

181
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,200
outside of its body so if you happen to

182
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,510
be near a Craig dilly while it's feeding

183
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,900
you will witness a terrifyingly

184
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:21,740
disgusting scene in plain sight number

185
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,750
three swalot swalot is similar in gross

186
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,300
'no stupid bill and craig dilly because

187
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,000
it also digests its prey all at once by

188
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,520
just melting them however swalot is

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,580
grosser in my opinion due to its method

190
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,410
of eating victreebel spray just goes in

191
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,020
the top of it Craig dilly spray just

192
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:42,470
gets wrapped up by tentacles but swalot

193
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,360
just shoves its prey in its mouth have

194
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,340
you ever seen the snake trying to eat a

195
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,880
piece of food that's larger than

196
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,110
diameter than itself it's gross so just

197
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,060
imagine swalot

198
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,250
trying to do that and at the same time

199
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,100
stomach acids are leaking out because

200
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,170
its entire body is its stomach just

201
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,390
think about what that would look like in

202
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:07,970
addition to that swalot sweats it sweats

203
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:10,790
poison swalot will be scarfing down prey

204
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,470
digesting it along the way while toxic

205
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,650
fluid is excreted from its pores that's

206
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:19,940
nasty

207
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,730
number 2 muck muck is a pile of sludge

208
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,310
which is obviously pretty gross in fact

209
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,770
it's so liquidy and sludgy that it's got

210
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,380
that one strand connecting across its

211
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:33,080
mouth which makes it look even grosser

212
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,910
but muck isn't just a gross looking pile

213
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,820
of well muck it smells absolutely rancid

214
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:44,540
or as the Pokedex describes it nose

215
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,300
bending lee horrible muck smells so bad

216
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,500
that the Pokedex had to make up a phrase

217
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,260
to describe it

218
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,580
muck also just causes death around it

219
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,350
plants that it touches died and

220
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,660
people who touch it get poisoned

221
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,800
horribly although apparently Professor

222
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,380
Oak is immune to that

223
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,630
but regardless much just slides around

224
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,330
killing all the plant life and leaving a

225
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,940
terrible smell which obviously leads to

226
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,190
a pretty disgusting scene a lowland muck

227
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,870
isn't as gross as regular muck mainly

228
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,000
due to the fact that it no longer smells

229
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,670
bad since it stores toxins within its

230
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,160
body plus solidified toxins are a lot

231
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,740
less gross than liquid or gas ones but

232
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,200
even so it's still kind of gross since

233
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,760
seeing any sentient pile of goo is

234
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,660
probably gonna make me feel fairly

235
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,519
disgusted number one Garr boater Corps

236
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,769
boater has gotten a lot of criticism for

237
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,959
being the garbage pokemon but whether or

238
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,240
not you think it's a good idea you have

239
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,720
to acknowledge that it's concept is just

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,190
gross its entire body is made up of

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,990
garbage think about what you throw away

242
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,300
tissues covered in boogers rants and

243
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,640
rotten eggs dog poop

244
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,450
all of that and more is part of garb

245
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,490
owners body and that is disgusting but

246
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,440
not only that this thing takes the

247
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,899
garbage that it's absorbed and creates

248
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,910
poisonous terrible smelling liquids and

249
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,990
gases that it either shoots out of its

250
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,579
hand or somewhat poetically belches

251
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,040
everything about gar boaters activities

252
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,200
and body is just plain gross and

253
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,110
therefore it is very deserving of its

254
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:24,930
spot as the most disgusting pokemon of

255
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:27,149

all time now just make sure you remember

258
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,940
just because these pokemon might be

259
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,270
pretty gross that doesn't mean that

260
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,560

me you can connect with so many people

62
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,709

63
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,709

64
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,360

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:11,589
chair like that I feel like that was an

302
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,880
ode to my right testicle which is now

303
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,839

304
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,720
fifteen percent smaller

305
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,630
I'm literally missing 15 percent of my

306
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,680
right testicle because of this vine that

307
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,440

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,520
some Bugs Bunny cap and I started

315
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,050
running and if you played the frame by

316
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,089
frame you'll see me going down there's

317
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,680
just a lone chair and you guys notice I

318
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,390
can do the splits oh go split the

319
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,390
bangbang text testicle Oh

320
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,219
five days later I'm compressing a lot of

321
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,509
time we I didn't go to the hospital I

322
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,579
didn't think was a big deal I was at my

323
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:59,619
friend's house and I'm swollen at this

324
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:01,389
point and one of my friends back in Ohio

325
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:02,889
we had split up was like hey does your

326
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:06,099
does your testicle look like this

327
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:07,569
avocado I was like funny it does look

328
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:10,179
like that like you need to a hospital

329
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,739
basically call went to the hospital and

330
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:13,389
you know my mom's like what do why

331
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:15,039
didn't you show me why I'm like mom not

332
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:16,479
showing you my balls to my bed if it's

333
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,069
at one point she's like I'm not gonna be

334
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:19,689
able have grandchildren we were worried

335
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,699
about getting my testicle removed no guy

336
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:23,199
wants one testicle I'll do it but no you

337
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:24,759
don't want to doc gives me an ultrasound

338
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,139
and he comes up and he's like okay good

339
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:26,979
news and bad news the good news is that

340
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,749
you're not going to have to get it

341
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:30,999
removed the bad news is that you have a

342
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:32,679
three-inch hematoma sitting at the

343
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:34,809
bottom of your testicle that we will

344
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,819
have to perform surgery and remove for

345
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:39,129
all the guys listening I'm sorry this is

346
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,629
like you will lose a testicle or part of

347
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,369
it at some point in your life fact I

348
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,079
don't know what that statistical

349
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:46,149
analysis is coming from it's a hundred

350
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,339
percent true I can verify the day of the

351
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,109
surgery I go in and the homeboy the

352
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,459
doctors outlining his procedure yeah

353
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:53,589
we're going to go in we're going to

354
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,479
remove the hematoma and if enough of it

355
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:57,579
is dead your testicle of course will

356
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:59,199
just go ahead and remove it I did what

357
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,359
would you just say that because you told

358
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,099
me you told me I was not getting my test

359
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,779
II removed because well that was the

360
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,169
original plan but if enough of it is

361
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,669
dead

362
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:09,849
where we are gonna have to pull this so

363
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:12,579
I literally woke up for my surgery not

364
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:15,819
knowing if I had two testicles I'm

365
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,499
holding my mom's pant I go mom just give

366
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,929

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,629
this is a video by real-life lore

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,400
sponsored by seriously digital

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,710
entertainment and our mobile game that's

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,990
seen briefly before the main portion of

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,759
the video begins in about 45 seconds I'd

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,590
like to thank my incredible sponsor

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,360
their game is about a meteorite that

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,160
crashes into a fictional planet that

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,539
apparently transforms it into a free

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,609
puzzle adventure game where you can

11
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,350
collect and upgrade little characters by

12
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,810
matching these same colored objects to

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,699
defeat virtual slugs in the real world

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,650
meteorite impacts often caused nothing

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,750
but mass destruction and chaos with

16
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,640
maybe a few extinction events but in

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,350
this virtual world it's actually created

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,210
a pretty fun game with some character

19
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,920
quests where you can win virtual prizes

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,230
like gold and hopefully not going

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,850
extinct there's quests every 50 levels

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,230
and you can play competitively against

23
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,940
your also non extinct friends on

24
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,070
Facebook through their leaderboards I'm

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,420
on there at level 32 so if you're the

26
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,800
type of person that has to be better

27
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,930
than you can download the game for free

28
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,699
with a link in the description and if

29
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,170
you actually play it to level 10 they'll

30
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,550
throw some free virtual gold and

31
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,000
diamonds your way that's apparently

32
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,890
worth $4.99 if you skip the video until

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,809
now then you should feel just a tiny bit

34
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,519
bad about yourself but the main portion

35
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,140
of the video begins now anyway

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,390
regardless so here's an interesting

37
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,580
question how many times has the earth

38
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,680
been struck by an asteroid when you look

39
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,939
at the moon or planets like Mercury you

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,290
can tell right away that they've been

41
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,180
impacted a lot because you can

42
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,770
physically count hundreds of craters on

43
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,290
their surface but this isn't really the

44
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,180
case with her perfectly preserved impact

45
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,770
craters are rare or blend in extremely

46
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,330
well with the environment here and it's

47
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,430
not because Earth has been impacted any

48
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,439
less it's because earth has processes

49
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,689
like erosion and tectonic activity that

50
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,610
the moon and Mercury don't the earth has

51
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,530
likely been hit by asteroids just as

52
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,540
many times as the moon or mercury in the

53
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,130
past but how many times have humans

54
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,290
actually witnessed an event like this

55
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,119
happening to start with the earth has

56
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,220
likely already been hit several times

57
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
today and may be getting hit right now

58
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,670
while you're watching this video by

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,860
extremely small pieces of rocks called

60
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,899
meteoroids which can range in size from

61
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,259
a grain of sand up to a one meter wide

62
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,520
object about 15,000 tons of objects of

63
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,710
this size enter the Earth's atmosphere

64
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,540
every year and while most of these don't

65
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,670
reach the surface the few that do are

66
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,810
called meteorites like this one that hit

67
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,569
somebody's house in the San Francisco

68
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,920
Bay area back in 2012 or this one that

69
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,989
smashed through somebody's car in

70
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,030
Illinois in 1938 but the larger and out

71
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,189
is the larger the damage that is caused

72
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,140
by it asteroids with a diameter of four

73
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,819
meters or about the size of an elephant

74
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,129
hit the earth about once every year on

75
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,540
average while objects about seven meters

76
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,189
wide which can cause an explosion

77
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,840
similar in scale to the atomic bomb

78
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:31,239
dropped on Hiroshima hit our planet

79
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,099
about every five years or so an event

80
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,780
the same scale of Hiroshima happening

81
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,700
every few years may seem like it would

82
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,230
be spectacularly obvious but they

83
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,489
generally go unnoticed because the

84
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,409
majority of the earth's surface is

85
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,909
covered in water a majority of the

86
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:44,620
Earth's landmass is still sparsely

87
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,569
populated and many of these objects

88
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,700
simply explode in the upper atmosphere

89
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,409
several impact events occur every year

90
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,980
without ever being witnessed by humans

91
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,269
between 1975 and 1992 for example

92
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,930
American missile early warning

93
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,459
satellites detected 136 major explosions

94
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,500
in the upper atmosphere caused by

95
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,629
moderately sized air bursting meteors

96
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,579
this map here shows you the frequency of

97
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:09,670
air burst meteors between 1 and 20

98
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:11,230
meters in size between 1994 and 2013

99
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,180
which you can see are fairly common

100
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,920
events but what about the really scary

101
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,019
asteroids that could wipe out an entire

102
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,019
city or even all of human civilization

103
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,819
you may be asking well asteroids about

104
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,530
20 meters wide about the size of a

105
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,599
six-story building hit the earth about

106
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,540
twice every 100 years and cause an

107
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,669
explosion of about 500 kilotons or about

108
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,470
30 times the scale of her Oshima the

109
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,599
last one of these sized events happened

110
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,180
fairly recently in 2013 over Chelyabinsk

111
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,709
Russia the asteroid remained undetected

112
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,540
by humanity until it entered the

113
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,909
atmosphere and weighed about the same as

114
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,040
the Eiffel Tower despite being just 20

115
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:47,199
meters wide it was witnessed by

116
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,819
thousands of people before exploding 30

117
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,819
kilometers above the ground which

118
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,849
damaged 7,200 buildings across six

119
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,349
different cities like this one injured

120
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,540
1,500 people severely enough to visit a

121
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,389
hospital and caused 30 million dollars

122
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,159
in damage coincidentally just 16 hours

123
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,019
after this meteor struck the earth

124
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,569
another asteroid that was 50 percent

125
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,720
larger at 30 meters wide just barely

126
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:13,150
missed the earth at a distance of only

127
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,620
27,000 700 kilometers or about the

128
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,720
distance of two earths placed

129
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,489
side-by-side the asteroids were not

130
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,289
related to each other and had completely

131
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,359
different orbits but it's not the first

132
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,310
weird coincidence

133
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,759
earth or even humanity has had with

134
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,490
near-miss asteroids on March 23rd 1989

135
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,319
an asteroid 300 metres wide about the

136
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,050
same size as this skyscraper in Dubai

137
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,969
missed the earth by just 700,000

138
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,560
kilometers and passed through the exact

139
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:40,560
same position that the earth was in a

140
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,050
mere six hours previously had that

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,180
asteroid been only six hours early on

142
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,800
its journey of millions of years it

143
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,840
would have impacted and caused the

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,409
largest explosion in all of recorded

145
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,120
history about 600 megatons or 12 times

146
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,620
the power of the Tsar Bomba

147
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,139
the largest nuclear weapon ever

148
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,669
detonated the largest meteor known to

149
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,439
have actually hit the earth during our

150
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:03,150
recorded history was probably the

151
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,300
Tunguska event which happened back in

152
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,849
1908 in that year an asteroid somewhere

153
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,250
between 60 metres and 190 meters wide

154
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,529
exploded just a few kilometers above the

155
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,689
remote wilderness of Siberia the power

156
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,120
of the explosion was somewhere between 3

157
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:20,939
& 5 megatons comparable to a modern-day

158
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,949
hydrogen bomb it is estimated that 80

159
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,020
million trees were destroyed by the

160
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,029
blast over an area about the size of

161
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,460
Rhode Island but because of the extreme

162
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:31,830
remoteness of Siberia especially in 1908

163
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,110
it's unknown if anybody actually died

164
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,060
from this event but the shockwave did

165
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,400
reportedly shattered windows and knocked

166
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,710
people down up to hundreds of kilometers

167
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,409
away an event like this is estimated to

168
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,360
happen only about every 1,200 years on

169
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,069
average but there are even larger

170
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,500
asteroids that have hit the earth in

171
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,009
prehistoric times that may hit us in the

172
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,900
future

173
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,060
asteroids the size of one kilometer

174
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,159
appear to hit our planet about once

175
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,009
every four hundred forty-four thousand

176
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:02,669
years and release about 23,000 megatons

177
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,379
or 460 SR bombas larger five kilometer

178
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,120
asteroids impact the earth about once

179
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:10,199
every 20 million years and can create

180
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,599
explosions equal to 2.84 Giga tons or 56

181
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,960
thousand eight hundred Tsar Bomba and

182
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:18,089
finally truly titanic asteroids over ten

183
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,099
kilometers in size that are capable of

184
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,169
ending life on the planet strike the

185
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,879
earth very rarely the last known

186
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,849
instance of something this big hitting

187
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:30,509
our planet with 66 million years ago but

188
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:32,139
it did completely wipe out about 75% of

189
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,270
all living things on the planet

190
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,560
including the dinosaurs assuming that

191
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,900
these rates continue for the next

192
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,139
billion years there exists right now

193
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,909
about 2,000 asteroids larger than one

194
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,099
kilometer that will eventually strike

195
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:48,009
our planet but when and where exactly

196
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,840
maybes apocalypse has happened to answer

197
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,060
that question we must understand that

198
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,710
there are an estimated 14 thousand

199
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,659
asteroids that are considered near-earth

200
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,199
objects meaning that their orbits come

201
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:00,610
relatively close to Earth at some point

202
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,529
93% of these asteroids that are one

203
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,419
kilometer wide or larger are thought to

204
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,759
have been discovered which would leave

205
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,889
about 70 of these massive objects

206
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,990
remaining so far undetected in the

207
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:14,469
darkness of all the asteroids that have

208
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,569
been discovered 1651 are considered by

209
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,659
NASA to be potentially hazardous out of

210
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:22,389
which 157 are larger than one kilometer

211
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,370
but unless humanity is absurdly unlucky

212
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,860
our odds of being struck by any of these

213
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,870
in the near future is almost nil the

214
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,629
most likely impact is with an asteroid

215
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,749
160 metres wide which would be bad if it

216
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,219
happened but the odds are only one in

217
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:40,300
625 and it wouldn't even hit until

218
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:42,669
sometime between 21 85 and 21 98 another

219
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,919
asteroid about 490 metres wide which

220
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:46,810
would be a lot worse but has just a one

221
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,310
in two thousand seven hundred chance of

222
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,800
hitting us around that same time frame

223
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,779
and the third most likely on the list is

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,889
a big one at one point three kilometers

225
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:58,360
wide but only has a 1 in 8333 chance of

226
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,419
hitting our planet in the distant future

227
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,039
of 2880 but that's still a little better

228
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,719
odds than you winning an Academy Award

229
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,580
sometime in your lifetime and

230
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,710
significantly better than your odds of

231
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,960
ever winning the lottery in the very far

232
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,300
distant future about 1 point 35 million

233
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,479
years from now the star Gliese 710 will

234
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,610
pass a mere 77 light days from the earth

235
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,649
which is 20 times closer to us than the

236
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,899
closest star is today and it would

237
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,029
severely mess up our solar system by

238
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,229
sending more asteroids flying towards us

239
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,110
from the outer reaches of the solar

240
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:30,939
system there are over 2,000 huge

241
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,190
asteroids waiting for our planet in the

242
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,959
distant future but will humanity still

243
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,690
be waiting around for their arrival when

244
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,339
they inevitably come knocking so thank

245
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,899

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
hello there how are you doing this video

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,120
is on selfie and iPhone hax I'm

constantly on my phone I'm not gonna lie

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,599
I literally wake up and my phones on

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,280
hand I go to the bathroom with my phone

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,630

comment down below letting me know what

11
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,490
age you were when you got your first

12
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,289
phone I was in ninth grade I was a

13
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,970
little bit of like a late bloomer with

14
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,769
the phone thing I connected with me on

15
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,599
my social media sites because uh I

16
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,429
actually have a theme going on now on

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
Instagram and I'm actually tweeting more

18
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,000
on Twitter and I snap all the time I

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,350
have a vlog channel me and my boyfriend

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
started a blog channel you guys should

21
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,520
definitely check it out just a young

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,200
couple traveling eating and doing weird

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,730
things so check it out right so you know

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,020

another phone hack if you accidentally

53
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,560
erase something on your phone and you're

54
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,990
a little clumsy like me and you know

55
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,150
there's no back button on here all you

56
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,560
gotta do is shake your phone I know I

57
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,939
couldn't believe this one I tried it out

58
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,130
and I was like are you kidding me this

59
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,600
is crazy how come they don't tell us

60
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,310
about this stuff like this this could be

61
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,750
really beneficial so now you know if you

62
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,600
want your selfie game to be bomb on

63
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,460
fleek amazing all I got to do is use the

64
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,960
remote on your earbuds to basically take

65
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,549
a selfie you know the plus and minus and

66
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,439
let's say you place it on a table you

67
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,939
can just have like the cord and then

68
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,710
wherever you want to take pictures just

69
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,570

70
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,310

86
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,140
pictures all you gotta do is buy like a

really cheap white fur and honestly it

88
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,860
could be anything but it has to be some

89
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,660
kind of current behind a window and then

90
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,680
you just stand in front of it and it's

91
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,290

92
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,060
aura like an angel just a really nice

93
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,500
softer look it's very angelic and it

94
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,120
also doesn't look like you're trying too

95
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,709
hard it's just like dang like she's

97
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:49,190
another iPhone hack which is great for

98
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,570
people that hate math so you know how

99
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,890
when you use your calculator and you're

100
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,360
like inputting all these numbers and

101
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,310
then you accidentally mess up and then

102
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,080
you're like dang it I start over Oh No

103
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,280
if you accidentally put in like a zero

104
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,930
or something all you got to do is swipe

105
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,400
to the right or to the left and I'll

106
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,870
just magically remove it all right this

107
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,410
next one is really weird hack but

108
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,550
basically if you say Brune in a picture

109
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,310
you're gonna get that really like

110
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,950
seductive lips pucker looks like Selena

111
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,930
Gomez always aces man like she has that

112
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,579
like - pucker look have you want that

113
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,090
more natural smile you can just say

114
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:22,130
mocha mocha it's kind of like like I

115
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,560
just gracefully fell into a laughter a

116
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,940
very natural graceful smile so nice okay

117
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,769
you're in a really dark place or in a

118
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,810
concert at a restaurant be someone take

119
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,180
that good selfie know what to do you

120
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,070
can't just like bring in or big light

121
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,570
it's gonna look very weird okay two

122
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:39,320
things you can do one you could have

123
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,340
somebody else shine a actually looks

124
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,980
ridiculous but you can have somebody

125
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,840
else shine the flashlight onto you guys

126
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,799
and then you take the picture or you can

127
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,269
just buy one of these little lights

128
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:49,670
that's like three bucks on eBay

129
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,570
so it's safe please trust me and or if

130
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,790
you want to take a really cute picture

131
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,440
with good quality whenever you take the

132
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,260
picture let's say you want to zoom in

133
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,430
don't zoom in onto the camera because

134
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,769
the picture will turn out super

135
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,359
pixelated instead just take the picture

136
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,250
and then you can zoom in where ever you

137
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,720
want and crop it out it will be much

138
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,489
better quality either solve yeah if you

139
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,750
want really nice quality pictures is you

140
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:10,670
don't really need a really expensive

141
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,320
camera I think some of the prettiest

142
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,630
pictures are actually just taken from a

143
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,940
phone die cans are a little more candid

144
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,200
as well it's kind of hard to see

145
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,630
so like there's no way of seeing

146
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,160
yourself from this angle so all you guys

147
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,140
do is just have a mirror in front of you

148
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,670
or any small pocket mirror there you go

149
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,800
I probably get the perfect selfie air

150
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,780
time all right guys that was it for

151
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,640
today's video I hope you enjoyed I hope

152
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,310
your selfie game won't be strong and I

153
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,750

Daniel hello hello there so uh due to

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,100
the fact that Mother's Day is just

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,289
tomorrow mom

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,910
we thought to be hoping to like idea why

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,740
that kind of has to do with Mother's Day

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,820
but also is just like a really fun thing

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:37,320
to do so we're making edible flowers

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,850
yeah cleaning um we're making them out

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,640
of starburst

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,570
Laffy Taffy and potentially airheads me

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:49,440
uh and then we have these like six um

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,780
but I'm so excited because this app I'm

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,850
absolutely obsessed with which is best

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,340
fiends which I talked about before I

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,670
wanted to do another sponsorship with me

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,649
so thank you best fiends for sponsoring

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,229
this video thank you for feeding his

22
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,720
addiction you play all the time so

23
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,580
you're I really do so honestly the first

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,729
time I mention it I was like oh yeah

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,340
pull out but after I post that video I

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,340
became addicted hardcore

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm already on level 112 and I'm stuck

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,470
but here is a little clip of me playing

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,020
and probably being a little frustrated

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,189
trying to beat it okay so basically this

31
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,229
game there's a whole bunch of different

32
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,470
levels with different objectives of

33
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,570
things that you have to do mostly just

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,479
defeating these like big black slime

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,869
things with your little cute creatures

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,909
that all correlate to a color um and the

37
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,430
more colors you connect the stronger it

38
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,579
is anyways it's really fun and super

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,619
addicting let me tell you but also in

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,770

49
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,709
DIY shall we ish

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,640
first things first you're gonna have to

51
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:18,530
that chill um the starburst and these

52
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,000
candies are pretty tough and you're

53
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,319
gonna be like mal you bowling though no

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,530
I bought you that dictionary you need

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:33,650
you're going I got word in my manually

56
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,120
malleable that word okay anyways um so

57
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,650
again it was like Oh what if we just

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,019
leave them outside the back yard on the

59
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,370
Sun and they'll become squishy not for a

60
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,650
few minutes yeah

61
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,730
not longer than like ten and it'll just

62
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,579
melt a little finger work out so this is

63
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:53,239
what I'm doing what colors are you I'm

64
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:54,890
just gonna do them all I'm doing Hank by

65
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,099
the way you should probably wash your

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,980
hands before yeah wash your hands really

67
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:03,500
hey I think just might be my time before

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,810
I film is I made you this dirty edible

69
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,940
flower so the lucky taffy and

70
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,269
potentially that our hats are going to

71
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,540
be the like leaves of it and the color

72
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:18,470
servers are going to be a the petals no

73
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:21,079
yeah another call dangles the flower

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:27,579
I'm a florist this is actually pretty

75
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:29,690
tough whoa a big ball whoa victim

76
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:30,170
terrible when are you seeing what he is

77
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,829
doing

78
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,200
this isn't psycho think that's

79
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,090
outrageous so we're just going to

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,120
basically just be squeezing these we'll

81
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,340
catch up with you guys in just a feel

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,060
okay this is actually like a huge long

83
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,560
workout I have arthritis honestly okay

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,720
so I found a technique that actually

85
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,720
makes this a lot quicker so here's your

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,989
life thing if you do a little twisting

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,630
motion like that and I totally like

88
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,790
makes it easier for you to squish this

89
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,680
time

90
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,650
you think well thanks for telling me

91
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,950
that little hat Daniels making his so oh

92
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,260
really he's not following the directions

93
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,500
he's just going a habit okay

94
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,979
so I'm going to start with my flower so

95
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,979
the first step is to take one of your

96
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:24,940
servers and like bend it into a Hershey

97
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:26,800
kiss of the shape like I you can see

98
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,880
that but hopefully the close-up camera

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,570
can so yeah you make this this is the

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,080
center of the flower and then you want

101
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,030
to flatten some other pieces for the

102
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,550
petals let me tell you something this

103
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,310
air conditioning is making these things

104
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,810
get hard and getting so work so oh

105
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,530
really

106
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,360
like Y&S little flat pancake you know

107
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,360
wrap it around like Hershey kiss all

108
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,190
gorgeous she's so beautiful

109
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,610
I'm only never Aoife she'd be like man

110
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,240
yet you go buy me something from China

111
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,400
it's the lava he'll visit okay so

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,860
honestly this is something that I would

113
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,560
do as a kid for my parents because I

114
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,260
actually did do this but not this

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
exactly it made your mom flowers from

116
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:23,590
gum not on their tables I found a carrot

117
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,760
in the fridge carved a face in it and

118
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,240
then like God some like blue makeup and

119
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,910
then I like put it in one of those like

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,860
jaw a quarter summer of which you may

121
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,479
have heard a blue moon all my buzzer I

122
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,639
was all for witches and childs and they

123
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:42,520
made potion no I was a witch to herself

124
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,599
over someone you know what meaning it

125
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,820
was looking shocked

126
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:50,650
hello Wow quack oh yeah lips what would

127
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,740
you do for Mother's Day as a child

128
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,919
oh my god I would make her breakfast in

129
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,750
bed

130
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,909
oh oh I got that brought back memory

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:04,060
okay so I was like making breakfast in

132
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:06,449
bed and Joey yeah I was like a 8 year

133
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,610
old should not have been using a knife

134
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,249
cutting an apple and it like went right

135
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,249
through the Apple and I cut like years

136
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:17,610
ago I cut like a big slit in my hand and

137
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:19,080
I nearly passed out oh poor you

138
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,789
so I've ruined my mother's Mother's Day

139
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
because she had blood all on her

140
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,240
breakfast

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,059
I was cooking since I was five years old

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,839
okay so I just keep wrapping these

143
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:32,430
around where what's your technique my

144
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,759
technique is doing the petals first

145
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,129
mines I guess trying to put tulip tiptoe

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,379
through the tulips oh we need the

147
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:43,589
sunlight in here we need to put these in

148
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,409
a frigging almost essentially I'm living

149
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:48,779
for this do you see I mean I don't know

150
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:51,449
any flower that looks these colors but I

151
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:53,849
don't think I've tried I have number 500

152
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:55,199
colors obviously I don't know how I'm

153
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:57,599
gonna make a whole bouquet of these

154
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,909
because this is hard to make well mom

155
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,389
you're just getting single rose dollar

156
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,689

Welcome to this special Wisecrack Edition on The Philosophy of BoJack Horseman, exploring the dark existential undertones of this seemingly light-hearted cartoon. Behind the colorful animations and snarky one-liners is a show that's astonishingly deep – a series that ponders important philosophical questions about living life in a meaningless universe. From Pascal to Sartre, we'll dive into the thinkers and philosophies that are foundational to the show's underlying message.

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,370
hey wisecrack Jared here and today we're

2
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:12,040
talking about the happiest show in the

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,259
Netflix catalog Bojack horseman with its

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,309
colorful animation talking animals and

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:17,110
Hollywood glamour

6
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,779
Bojack might look like your typical

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,820
happy-go-lucky cartoon but this is far

8
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,800
from the case the show's light-hearted

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,840
veneer hides a dark and downright

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,640
depressing reality which is fitting

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,380
given its focus on the disillusionment

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,580
that inevitably comes when you look

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,980
beneath the surface

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,079
Bojack reveals the ugly narcissistic

15
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,420
reality that lies behind the dazzling

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,800
facade of Hollywood most important thing

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,289
is you got to give the people what they

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,610
want even if it kills you even if it

19
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,559
empties you out until there's nothing

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,250
left to empty from mr. peanut butters

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,350
feigned interest I want to talk to you

22
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,510
Erica to studio executives only focused

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,309
on money to meaningless award ceremonies

24
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,410
that only reward those with established

25
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:58,300
names in other words Hollywood's a real

26
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,370
pretty town that's smack on top of all

27
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,320
that black tar by the time you realize

28
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,660
you're sinking it's too late but the

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,550
show goes far deeper Hollywood could be

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,140
considered a metaphor for existence in

31
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,000
general just like the facade of

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,220
Hollywood covers up the reality of an

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,660
ugly hollow industry the trappings of

34
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,090
our daily lives cover up the

35
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,550
meaninglessness of existence itself this

36
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,800
idea known as existential nihilism is

37
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,570
foundational to Bojack horseman if life

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,310
is truly meaningless then how are we

39
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,840

cope with the anguish of a meaningless

64
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,990
world is to simply distract yourself I

65
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,840
just wanted to do something light and

66
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,060
fun

67
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,730

sadness that is my life Princess

Carolyne persistently distracts herself

70
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,640
with her job and her compulsive need to

71
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,900
fix the life of those she cares about

72
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,700
despite complaining about work

73
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,349
dominating her life she can't actually

74
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,420
handle the free time that comes without

75
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:34,519
it are you gonna head out soon where

76
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,959
else would I go when her agency folds

77
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,239
she finally has time for the

78
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,860
relationship she always wanted but still

79
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
finds a way to get right back to the

80
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,230
Hollywood rhinestone I think I'm having

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,390
an epiphany I'm gonna be a manager Todd

82
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,040
bow Jack's best friend and perpetual

83
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,310
mooch is happy so long as he has

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,200
something to do but ray a task the one

85
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,180
time we do see Todd without anything to

86
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,280
do he immediately starts to spiral into

87
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,829
existential despair I need something to

88
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,200
do a job or a task or a direction in

89
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,269
life do I have a purpose before finding

90
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,129
something to take his mind off it Todd

91
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,629
may not have much direction or common

92
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:11,180
sense but he manages to keep himself

93
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:13,040
busy he composes a space opera builds

94
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,019
his own Disneyland and starts a number

95
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,420
of businesses an All Hallows Eve stole

96
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,420
in January how fiendishly drove

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,410
similarly mr. peanut butter spends his

98
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,269
life in a constant state of distraction

99
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,010
though he may seem like a moron

100
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:29,810
he's so stupid he doesn't realize how

101
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,609
miserable he should be mr. peanut butter

102
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,519
is more self-aware than most the

103
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,380
universe is a cruel uncaring void the

104
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,389
key to being happy isn't the search for

105
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,000
meaning is to just keep yourself busy

106
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,190
with unimportant nonsense and eventually

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,139
you'll be dead and then there's Bojack

108
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,239
bojack's whole life is a series of

109
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:49,340
distractions the way Bojack spends his

110
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,380
days is so trivial that the show often

111
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,590
makes a joke of not showing us what he's

112
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:57,669
doing half the time yeah two days I can

113
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,669
do all those things

114
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,030
oh shit I didn't do any of those things

115
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,450
in fact in the years since horsing

116
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,800
around

117
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,480
Bojack has been able to drift through

118
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,400
life in your constant state of

119
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,710
distraction horsing around

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,290
that ended eleven years ago really where

121
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,690
does the time go but in the first

122
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,130
episode Bojack has a mild anxiety attack

123
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,870
that sends him to the hospital

124
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,250
the doctor tells him he needs to take it

125
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,230
easier take it easy

126
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,000
are you kidding he doesn't have a job he

127
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,040
has no real responsibilities he doesn't

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,900
do anything but take it easy the show

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,480
asks a question commonly directed at

130
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,130
celebrities they have everything so how

131
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,200
could they not be happy great house

132
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,850
great career great life that must be why

133
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,860
I'm so goddamn happy all the time this

134
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,690
question was addressed by 17th century

135
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,610
philosopher Blaise Pascal who was

136
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,920
considered by many to be a precursor to

137
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,630
the existentialist for Pascal when given

138
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,190
too much time to think humans will

139
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,200
eventually contemplate their own

140
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,420
insignificance which inevitably bums

141
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,130
them out or as Pascal puts it I have

142
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,350
discovered that all the unhappiness of

143
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,060
men arises from one single fact that

144
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,770
they cannot stay quietly in their own

145
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,990
chamber I have found that there is one

146
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,430
very real reason namely the natural

147
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,590
poverty of our feeble and mortal

148
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,030
condition so miserable that nothing can

149
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,030
comfort us when we think of it closely

150
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,020
for Pascal humans have a natural

151
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,120
psychological defense mechanism that

152
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,130
keeps these thoughts at bay we're really

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,110
easily distracted and when we're

154
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,510
distracted we stop thinking about our

155
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,610
existence and can be if not happy at

156
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,560
least functional Pascal directly

157
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,600
addresses the unhappy celebrity question

158
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,400
though he uses kings instead of movie

159
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,350
stars yet when we imagine a king

160
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,660
intended with every pleasure he can feel

161
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,550
if he be without diversion and be left

162
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,680
to consider and reflect on what he is

163
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,320
this feeble happiness will not sustain

164
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,690
like a king Bojack has no serious

165
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,460
struggle to occupy his life instead he

166
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,530
has to spend all of his time trying to

167
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,090
distract himself so that he never has to

168
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,490
think about the reality of his situation

169
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,440
although he succeeds in doing this for

170
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,030
years the whole charade comes crashing

171
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,520
down when he reads Diane's book

172
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,590
one-trick pony in the book Bojack sees

173
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,630
an honest reflection of himself warts

174
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,850
and all he is forced to face all the

175
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,110
things he really is and isn't and to

176
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,090
confront the extent of his

177
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,280
self-deception I love the part about how

178
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,990
you became famous so you could be costly

179
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,550
surrounded by distraction wouldn't have

180
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,650
to be alone with yourself so what should

181
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,370
Bojack do now that his distraction has

182
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,960
crow

183
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,520
for Pascal once you've passed the

184
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,740
critical point where diversion will no

185
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,320
longer sustain you the only recourse is

186
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,980
to turn to God but for Bojack this isn't

187
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,380
an option

188
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,360
it seems that hollywoo is a post god is

189
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,370
dead world in the christmas special the

190
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,710
show uses Santa Claus as a stand-in to

191
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,690
discuss the non-existence of God he's a

192
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,520
lie that grown-ups made up because we

193
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,260
like to believe that there's an order to

194
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,880
the universe and that good behavior will

195
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,550
lead to happiness but the fact is that

196
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,160
just isn't true but if there's no God

197
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,020
where are we supposed to turn for Bojack

198
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,820
the first choice is right back to

199
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,530
distraction the show provides two

200
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,300
separate case studies of what happens

201
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,280
when you try to force distraction after

202
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,650
the illusion has been broken and neither

203
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,270
ends well first Secretariat gives a

204
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,550
young Bojack advice that basically

205
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,020
amounts to don't think about it Bojack

206
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,900
when you get sad

207
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:02,180
you run straight ahead and and you keep

208
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,710
running forward no matter what there are

209
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,660
people in your life who are gonna try to

210
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,190
hold you back slow you down but you

211
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,870
don't let them don't you stop running

212
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,390
and don't you ever look behind you

213
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,180
there's nothing for you behind you all

214
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,950
that exists is what's ahead but once

215
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,450
he's disqualified from racing and can no

216
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,250
longer keep the thoughts at bay

217
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:23,300
you could be the fastest runner in the

218
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,430
world but you can't outrun the truth the

219
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,380
second case is Sara Lynn Bojack drag

220
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,200
Sara Lynn on a month-long bender that

221
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,090
only ends when she ODS on well Bojack

222
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,530
the heroin not the horse looking back on

223
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,020
it that might have been a bit on the

224
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,330
nose if trying to reclaim his distracted

225
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,850
state is doomed to end in tragedy what

226
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,920
other options does Bojack have part two

227
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,020
radical freedom from the beginning

228
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,760
Bojack rejects responsibility I'm

229
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,320
responsible for my own happiness I can't

230
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,420
even be responsible for my own breakfast

231
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,490
he wants to escape the realities of his

232
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,660
own terrible life choices I didn't do

233
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,150
anything wrong because I can't do

234
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,610
anything wrong everything is meaningless

235
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:01,220
nothing I do has consequence after his

236
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,930
first bender Bojack asks Diane am I just

237
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,460
doomed to be the person that I am look

238
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,900
at the person in that book I know that I

239
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,370
can be selfish narcissistic and

240
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,650
self-destructive but underneath all that

241
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,910
deep down I'm a good person and I need

242
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,890
you to tell me that I'm good

243
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,660
Bojack is afraid of what 20th century

244
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,940
French philosopher jean-paul Sartre

245
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,490
called radical freedom which was a major

246
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,160
focus of his philosophy existentialism I

247
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,350
stand

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,150
my critique of sastra his philosophical

249
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,400
arguments helped many tyrannical regimes

250
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,170
justify over cruelty also the French

251
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,540
smell and I hate them if existentialism

252
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,970
had a catchphrase it would be existence

253
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,650
precedes essence and object's essence

254
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,810
for Sartre can be thought of as its

255
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,580
purpose if I make a hammer I create it

256
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,740
with a particular purpose in mind

257
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,349
ie hammer so we would say that the

258
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,900
hammers essence precedes its existence

259
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,540
for a Christian a human is like a hammer

260
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,730
a tool created by God with a purpose in

261
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,840
mind but for an existential nihilist

262
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,580
humans and horsemen exist just because

263
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,500
unlike a hammer or a gentle Farms

264
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,960
chicken there's no purpose underlying

265
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,210
bojack's existence and nothing that he's

266
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,040
meant to do there's nothing stopping

267
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,230
Bojack from stealing the D from the

268
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Hollywood sign or doing 3 months worth

269
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,920
of drugs and on the flip side there's

270
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,580
nothing forcing him to do those things

271
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,860
either

272
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,630
Bojack has total control over every

273
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,640
choice he makes this is what Sartre

274
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,710
meant by radical freedom and it's

275
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,450
definitely not supposed to be comforting

276
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,580
that is what I mean when I say that man

277
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,890
is condemned to be free condemned

278
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,690
because he did not create himself yet is

279
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,400
nevertheless at liberty and from the

280
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,740
moment that he is thrown into this world

281
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,620
he is responsible for everything he does

282
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,540
or as Diane and Bojack put it that's the

283
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,490
thing I don't think I believe in deep

284
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,140
down I kind of think all you are is just

285
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,950
the things that you do well that's

286
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,440
depressing

287
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,270
there is no good Bojack deep down there

288
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,370
was only the one Bojack and he is

289
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,480
entirely defined by the choices he's

290
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,460
made so far

291
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,740
or as Todd puts it the bow Jack at the

292
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,750
end of season 3 you are all the things

293
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
that are wrong with you while this may

294
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,130
not seem too comforting it does offer

295
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,050
Bojack one bit of hope yes that means

296
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,210
bow Jack is defined by the choices he's

297
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,860
made so far but he's not doomed to be

298
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,960
the person in that book forever

299
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,150
he has the freedom to change his actions

300
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,550
and himself but it's entirely up to him

301
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,100
to do so it's never too late to be the

302
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,140
person you want to be you need to choose

303
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,420
the life you want the show provides the

304
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,430
optimistic take on start by using water

305
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,880
as a metaphor for bojack's radical

306
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,860
freedom

307
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,780
Bojack often finds himself overwhelmed

308
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,030
by water but at the end of the

309
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,589
underwater episode in season 3 after

310
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,070
falling from the ledge of the taffy

311
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,440
factory

312
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,200
Bojack finally recognizes the water for

313
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,420
what it is not an overwhelmed

314
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,240
scary force but instead a medium of

315
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,070
incredible opportunity part 3 embraced

316
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,660
the absurd when mr. peanut butters

317
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,850
brother gets sick he goes through his

318
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,950
own existential crisis come to work

319
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,440
clock in he puts sugar in your coffee

320
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,600
watch it slowly disappear into

321
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,670
nothingness the sugar doesn't know why

322
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,110
sugar didn't ask to be born but he

323
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,820
doesn't suffer through it for very long

324
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,290
I realized something today when my

325
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,940
brother called from the hospital and I

326
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,950
think it's gonna make you feel a lot

327
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,240
better what what is it none of this

328
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,250
matters

329
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
Bojack gets similar advice from his old

330
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,360
writing partner and Harvard alum cuddly

331
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,980
whiskers who abandon his Hollywood Life

332
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,050
the Noster is meaningless it's all

333
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,150
meaningless and is finally able to find

334
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,550
happiness only after you give up

335
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,860
everything can you begin to find a way

336
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,140
to be happy mr. peanut butter and cuddly

337
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,850
whiskers past the happiness after or

338
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,250
even because of the realization of

339
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,650
nihilism invokes the 20th century French

340
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,110
thinker Albert Camus and his philosophy

341
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,150
of absurdism for Camus the universe is

342
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,490
irrational and meaningless and yet

343
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,080
humans are desperate to find reason and

344
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,450
meaning in it and he calls this

345
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,580
discrepancy the absurd once you become

346
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,440
aware of the absurd you only have three

347
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,820
choices return to the cycle of daily

348
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,430
life and don't think about it

349
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:49,160
commit suicide or his preferred option

350
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,170
rebellion ie accept the absurd and be

351
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,910
happy anyway because screw the universe

352
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,070
for thinking it can control how you feel

353
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,200
Camus illustrates these ideas in his

354
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,730
essay the myth of Sisyphus about a man

355
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,980
who is doomed to push a rock up a hill

356
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,970
each day only to watch it roll back down

357
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,460
again

358
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,590
Sisyphus becomes cow Moos absurd hero

359
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,140
when he recognizes the absurdity of his

360
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:11,120
task but decides to be happy in spite of

361
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,280
it the show directly references the myth

362
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,960
of Sisyphus I have to push a boulder up

363
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,940
the hill and then have it roll over me

364
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,740
time and time again there's also the

365
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,840
recurring symbol of the baboon jogging

366
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,940
up the hill outside bojack's house every

367
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,490
day he's running up that same Hill it

368
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,650
gets easier huh every day it gets a

369
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,960
little easier yeah but you got to do it

370
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,940
every day that's the hard part at the

371
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,650
end of season three Bojack comes face to

372
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,540
face with the meaningless loop of his

373
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,690
life in the young actress from ethan

374
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,600
around i want to be like you like me

375
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,790
I wanna be famous oh no it happens that

376
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
the stage set collapses at the end of

377
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,800
the awakening comes in time the

378
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,050
consequence suicide or recovery just as

379
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,850
Camus describes Bojack runs out of the

380
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,400
stage set and begins to drive into

381
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,620
nowhere driving has repeatedly served as

382
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,300
a way for Bojack to try and escape the

383
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,430
absurd may be his own take on

384
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,240
Secretariat's advice to run and don't

385
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,890
look back

386
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,260
but when he releases the steering wheel

387
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,720
Bojack gives in submitting himself to

388
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:10,880
the absurd and to suicide however when

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
he sees the wild horses they represent

390
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,200
for him the alternative embrace the

391
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,450
absurd carry out your meaningless task

392
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,150
and be happy in spite of it they may be

393
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,190
seen as absurd heroes a group of horses

394
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,950
who have embraced running purely for its

395
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,720
own sake like Sisyphus they run carry

396
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:27,440
out the meaningless tasks and are happy

397
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
anyway

398
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,160
Bojack has proven himself willing to

399
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,750
give everything up maybe he's ready to

400
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,840
follow cuddly whiskers advice and

401
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,000
finally start to become happy conclusion

402
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,860
the show does offer one possible

403
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,410
solution to Bojack struggle for meaning

404
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,580
family and our age it's weird if you

405
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,220
don't have a family

406
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,050
I mean well no for you no cuz you've

407
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,880
been busy right with your career sure

408
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,010
when you pay attention to all the times

409
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,200
Bojack watches horsing around the scenes

410
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,520
all revolve around the in show family

411
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,260
I've learned that when you're in the

412
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,410
loving family there's nothing wrong with

413
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:02,330
a little horsing around during the first

414
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,520
big bender he is a vision of himself as

415
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,840
a simple family man bojack's attempt to

416
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,000
sleep with penny at the end of season

417
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,950
two illustrates how desperate he is to

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,870
start over and choose the domestic life

419
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,910
he could have had with Charlotte the

420
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,710
wild horses may represent more than just

421
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,780
the absurd hero they may also represent

422
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,940
the herd and a sense of belonging that

423
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,860
Bojack lacks and with the teaser at the

424
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,300
end of season 3 it seems the show is

425
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,520
preparing to explore this theme of

426
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,560
family much more though I hope it works

427
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,240
out for him something tells me that even

428
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,700
family won't be able to fill the void

429
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,530

get jealous of your achievements even

24

your smallest achievements enrage them

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,190
they cannot put up with the idea that

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,050
someone's business is going well they

27
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,300
can like your photos on Instagram but

28
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,850
when you meet them in person it's easy

29
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,490
to notice they're jealous of you it's

30
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,170
literally written on their faces

31
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,539
number two good friends know the

32
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,310

we all can't stand the hustle and bustle

34
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,139
of big cities so we need our private

35
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,359
time spend this time on meditating

36
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:23,060
thinking reading good books or walking

37
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,249
our true friends understand this and

38
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,490

all your time and attention they easily

43
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,560
get offended when you want to spend some

44
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,020
time alone and complain about you to

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,649

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,770
phrase I just want to help you but they

58
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,550
don't help at all they make you feel

59
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,340
awkward

60
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,530
and uncomfortable number four good

61
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,660
friends respect you and value your

62
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,520
friendship you're a very important

63
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,280
person for them so they know how to

64
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,750
argue without being personal also if

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
something goes wrong when you travel

66
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,250
together they'll just laugh at all the

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,590
troubles toxic friends lose their

68
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,120
tempers easily they can even shout at

69
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,640
you in front of other friends or in

70
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,770
public if something goes wrong or not

71
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,670
according to their plan they lose their

72
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,380
temper very quickly and become a monster

73
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,900
number five good friends enjoy

74
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,790
exchanging opinions they're interested

75
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,130
in your opinion and always listen to you

76
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,250
if they disagree with you I'll express

77
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,590
it in the mildest form toxic friends

78
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,420
only want to win an argument they hardly

79
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,150
reckon with your opinion because they

80
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,330
think that only they are right and they

81
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,090
try to prove it by any means number six

82
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:09,740
good friends believe your words well of

83
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,420
course they won't believe you if you say

84
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,280
you're moving to Mars next weekend but

85
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,050
they usually believe all your stories

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,300
when you tell them something interesting

87
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,450
for instance from documentaries they

88
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,450
believe every word toxic friends doubt

89
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,430
everything you say they're like are you

90
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,040
sure I think it's better than ask Google

91
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,010
no matter what you say they always want

92
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,020
to double-check number seven good

93
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,190
friends call you because they miss you

94
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,290
how was your day

95
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,060
is everything okay if you miss your

96
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,489
class or work they'll be the first to

97
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,340
call to ask whether you're alright they

98
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:44,930
miss you and they worry about you toxic

99
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,560
friends find you only when they need

100
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,170
your help

101
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,940
hey can you pick me up right now help me

102

no come on world friends numberings good

104
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,700
friends except you the way you are even

105
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,650
if you wear all bright colors together

106
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,050
sing on the streets or spend all your

107
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,870
weekends riding a canoe they appreciate

108
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,810
your wings they don't care they love you

109
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,430
toxic friends try to change and control

110
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,519
you they always say something like

111
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:16,340
what's better for you is or you have to

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,100
try this they find it hard to reconcile

113
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,020
themselves with your lifestyle let's be

114
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,720
honest their advice is so

115
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,580
number nine good friends know that

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,470
everyone has their friends and they

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,030
won't judge you for that they might even

118
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,650
become good friends with your other

119
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,960
friends if you introduce them to each

120
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,460
other if not they'll still respect the

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,220
fact that you like to spend time with

122
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,200
your other friends and colleagues toxic

123
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,930
friends don't like your other friends

124
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,460
remember they're like spiders they don't

125
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,830
want to share you with other people and

126
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,410
even with your family they always want

127
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,540
to be the center of your life

128
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,030
number 10 good friends know how to keep

129
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,070
a secret if you tell them please don't

130
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:58,200
tell anyone they'll take it seriously

131
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,750
don't worry your secrets won't fly

132
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,730
around the world toxic friends say

133
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,470
things they shouldn't say and they

134
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,630
always add I shouldn't have told you

135
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,970
this if your friend tells you other

136
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,250
secrets it means he or she would spread

137
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,220
your secrets as well just avoid their

138
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,100

I'm very excited for all the videos I

have come in okay without further ado

33
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:05,330
let's get into the hacks hack number one

34
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,710
you get stick of the filters the

35
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,040
snapchat gives you and you wish there

36
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,230
were more

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,810
well now you can add a colored filter to

38
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,250
any snap you want using an emoji now how

39
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,870
you do this is you simply take the

40
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,250
picture you want to take add the emoji

41
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,500
that you want I would say one with a

42
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,450
bright color and you simply keep zooming

43
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,220
in and pushing the emoji to the corner

44
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,620
over and over again until you get that

45
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,030
pixelated faded look from the edge of

46
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,830
the emoji and it actually ends up

47
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,960
covering the whole snap and making it a

48
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,100
different color before we go on to the

49
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,630
next hack I just wanted to thank

50
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,340

VP and back to the hacks hack number two

69
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,140
you always wonder how people snapchat

70
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,280
hands-free I'm always pushing the button

71
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,590
and I didn't know there was a way to do

72
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,780
it hands-free but now there is the first

73
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,640
go to settings then go to general then

74
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,530
go to accessibility under the

75
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,959
interactive section select on the

76
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,120
assistive touch feature then a small dot

77
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
icon will appear on your screen next tap

78
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,810

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,050
if you would with a snap and let the

81
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,700
blue bar on the bottom max out then you

82
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,459
just save and name the gesture so I

83
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,470
named mine snapchat because duh snapchat

84
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,120
next you open snapchat and before you

85
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,530
start recording a video tap the small

86
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,209

select custom and from there you should

88
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,110
be able to select the gesture that you

89
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,819
just made and it'll start recording hack

90
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,709
number three is for adding really cool

91
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,209
borders to your photos in order to do

92
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:51,950
this just add a letter any letter you

93
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:53,540
want that has a cool shape make it a

94
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,489
cool color and zoom it out all the way

95
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,940
until it fits your picture pack number

96
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:57,290
four

97
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,580
now this next hack is for all you

98
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,959
artists out there who wish that you

99
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,580
could make more detailed drawings on

100
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,230
snapchat or you see other people do it

101
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,090
and you wonder how they do it so to be

102
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,560
more like Picasso yourself this is all

103
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,030
you need to do open settings on your

104
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,130
phone and go to general tap

105
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,560
accessibility under the vision section

106
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,940
enable the zoom select show controller

107
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,100
choose your zoom region

108
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,630
I would prefer the window one and then

109
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,519
set the maximum zoom level all the way

110
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,230
up to 15 and from there go to snapchat

111
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,209
and you can literally zoom in and you

112
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,100
can see so much closer so you can draw a

113
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,840
lot closer onto your snapchat and you'll

114
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,609
be Picasso you're welcome I'll be here

115
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,840
open hack number five you ever add

116
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,220
someone and wonder if they had you back

117
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,230
but you literally don't know how to find

118
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,150
out well all you need to do is go to add

119
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,829
friends click add by username and then

120
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,420
start typing the person's username once

121
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:40,010
you see their name pop up top and hold

122
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,600
their username and if you can see their

123
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,850
snapchat score then you know they added

124
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,500
you back if you can't see it that's

125
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,150
awkward they didn't add you hack number

126
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,739
six is four if you want to create a

127
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,540
snapchat with beautiful multicolored

128
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:51,889
lettering all you do is simply type the

129
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,690
text how you normally would but then

130
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:55,190
when you open the text box click select

131
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,660
and you can select one letter two

132
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,459
letters a whole word and you can make

133
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,900
that a certain color before going back

134
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,310
in and making the rest of the word or

135
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,139
the rest of the letters a different

136
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,670
color it's actually really easy never

137
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,380
knew you can do that fact number seven

138
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,790
we all knew you could do two filters at

139
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,400
a time on snapchat but did you know you

140
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,599
could do three maybe you did I didn't so

141
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,980
all you do is take the picture that

142
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,290
you're gonna take and swipe the first

143
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,000
filter you want then hold

144
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,620
your finger on the screen and swipe to

145
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,940
select the second filter you want this

146
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,709
part we already know but did you know

147
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,360
that if you lift your finger again and

148
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,740
put your finger back on and hold it and

149
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,479
swipe again you can get a third filter

150
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,780
so you can have the location of filter

151
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,070
the temperature all in one snapchat hack

152
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,930
number eight do you guys know that you

153
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,220
can play music in a snapchat you

154
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,780
probably knew this because I've seen a

155
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,130
lot of people do it but just in case you

156
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,360
didn't know all you have to do is play

157
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,949
music on the background or your phone

158
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,139
from iTunes or Spotify or whatever you

159
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:45,580
want and then open snapchat and you take

160
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,650
your snap and it will record the music

161
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,690
that's also playing but tip you cannot

162
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,740
use YouTube for this because YouTube

163
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,960
doesn't work unless you have YouTube

164
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,639
read-back number 9 you want to have an

165
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,720
emoji moving around in a video but you

166
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,979
don't know how and you keep seeing

167
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,270
people do it and you still don't know

168
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,650
how and it really bothers you can you

169
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,509
tell if all theirs needs well I finally

170
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,280
learned how to do it so first take the

171
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,960
video that you want to take then select

172
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,699
the emoji you want and size it to the

173
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,349
size you want tap and then hold the

174
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:10,419
emoji and move it to where you want it

175
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:12,310
to be tracking so for example if my head

176
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,500
is moving like this in a snapchat and I

177
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,419
want the pig face emoji over my head and

178
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,130
I would move it to my head and then it

179
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,050
would know to follow my head ok hack

180
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,710
number 10 is that you can actually have

181
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,240
your own geofilter what now this blew my

182
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,919
mind over the fourth of July Shelby and

183
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,930
Monica created their own geofilter and I

184
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,669
was like yo how do you do that

185
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,470
apparently it's actually really cheap to

186
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,940
do so but it only lasts a couple days so

187
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,409
I'll leave the link below to a website

188
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,240
that instructs you on how to make your

189
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:39,610
own geotag but yeah you can totally do

190
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,440
that and it's really legit and finally

191
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,970
number eleven now this one isn't

192
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
necessarily useful but it's just

193
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,539
interesting and I never knew it was a

194
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,900
thing so each person's snapchat profile

195
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:52,630
actually as a website you go to WWF calm

196
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,639
slash add slash your username you can

197
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,050
see your little snapchat icon it's just

198
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,520
kind of cool if you want a screenshot it

199
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,500
or send it to someone that's what you

200
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,570

Happy Mother's Day to all of you moms and grandmothers out there! We are super appreciative to Best Fiends for partnering with us on this special vlog for you! This day is one of my most favorite days of the year! Why is that? Because Shaun and the kids do their ""very best"" to make sure it is a day where I don't have to worry about schedules, cooking, cleaning, refereeing, morning and nighttime routines, etc? No, it isn't even all of those things being taken care of. Yes, I love the hand drawn cards and the gifts that I get from them, too, yet it isn't all of those things that I enjoy the very most either! I sure enjoy all the personal time the kids give me, but it isn't that either. Well, then... what is it?

I love Mother's Day because I get to reflect on my own mother, and my grandmothers who have passed on, and what I love most about them all. Then I get to hug and hold each of my own children, cherishing the very best of motherhood. It's those giggles, hugs, kisses, and ""I love you, mommy!"" statements that I love the very most!

Please be sure to give this video a BIG ""👍🏻"" if you loved it, then please go give your own mom (or other influential female figure) a huge hug or a quick phone call to tell her how much she means to you. Then leave a comment below telling us that you have done that!

We hope that you all enjoy this Behind the Braids look into our home on Mother's Day, and feel a part of our family. We love each one of you!

this project is from Korea and

apparently it's supposed to remove bumpy

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,500
dead skin and impurities from your

29
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,840
armpit the main ingredients are ethyl

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,330
hexa glycerin which helps to manage bad

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,760

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,450
skin and there's aloe vera and cucumber

36
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,850
extract which helps to protect sensitive

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,820
skin from irritation now when it comes

38
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,479
to my armpits that's an area that I'm

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,040
pretty sensitive about in the past I

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,320
mean you guys have commented and said

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,390
that like I forgot to show my underarms

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,820
but actually like I get later so I'm

43
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,710
actually I have no hair under there but

44
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,200
it's just kind of like naturally dark

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,450
because previously when I was younger I

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,430
would always shave my underarms and that

47
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,689
makes your skin like more pigmented and

48
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:56,490
dark so hence I have like dark underarms

49
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,890
I promise there's no hair there so I'm

50
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,130
pretty like pretty bearish when you guys

51
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,110
point it out so this product I'm really

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,689
excited about because I really hope that

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,729
it does white not my underarms do any of

54
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,950
you guys have this problem please let me

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,780
know

56
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,150
like the only reader out there would

57
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,400
like dark underarms now with this

58
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,030
product you're not supposed to use it on

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,890
like skin with any open cuts or X smile

60
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,620
like if you have like really sensitive

61
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,900
skin there's a disclaimer to not try

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,400
this product out actually now that makes

63
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,569
me kind of scared like is it's like

64
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,120
super strong is it going to like

65
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:33,340
completely bleach my underarms I don't

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,230
know but we'll just give it a go so

67
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,269
first you need to start off with clean

68
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,830
underarms I have deodorant on so I'm

69
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,380
just going to use baby wipes to take it

70
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,170
off so just showing my armpits to the

71
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,019
world right now it's super embarrassing

72
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,840
ah so dark I'm so embarrassed

73
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,519
don't laugh for me guys okay so what

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,130
you're supposed to do is apply this

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,160
product now the consistency is pretty

76
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,840
thick and it's like white so you're

77
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,700
supposed to just apply it on your skin

78
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,130
like wait for like a minute or two and

79
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,959
it'll like set and dry and then you kind

80
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,370
of just like rub it off and I think it

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
just turns into like a powder or

82
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,349
something and then you remove the excess

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,610
with lukewarm water and hopefully your

84
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:14,430
underarms will look brighter

85
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,970
I'm just gonna squeeze some of that out

86
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:22,239
let's start off with this much first I'm

87
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,370
just gonna like apply it on like this is

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,260
a bit layer it doesn't look them because

89
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,299
the product is actually really opaque

90
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,780
looks like cream cheese

91
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:36,220
okay so I've just evenly applied a layer

92
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,930
of the armpit brightener and my gosh my

93
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,910
shoulders are really sauces like a

94
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,040
workout just keeping my arms up like

95
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:45,389
this so I still let it set for about a

96
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,910
minute or two and I know that's like

97
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,590
that's all I have to do in terms of how

98
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,170
it smells actually smells really nice it

99
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:56,380
kind of smells like kind of smells like

100
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,730
a florally baby powder if you get what I

101
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,610
mean

102
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,690
just gonna let it dry

103
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:08,300
I hope this thing works like look at the

104
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,800
difference gosh so dark how dark it is

105
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:13,710
company people think it's hair so

106
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,680
embarrassing okay so I feel like it's

107
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,980
dry you just like touch it

108
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:24,620
yeah it's dry there's no transfer so use

109
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,620
just supposed to like gently rub it away

110
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,780
[Music]

111
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,870
I'm making such a mess is so messy it's

112
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,789
was falling on the ground she was done

113
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:39,180
with in the bathroom and I think I have

114
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:41,160
to like it every single bit of it off

115
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,880
because it just says to wash off with

116
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,470
some warm water after it looks kind of

117
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,410
wider but I think it's just because it's

118
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,270
like chalky okay I'm going to quickly

119
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,759
wash this off with water and I'll be

120
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,050
right back so I'm back are you ready to

121
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,120
see my armpits

122
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:01,530
now I thought it ever happened you want

123
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,910
that but are you ready here it is do you

124
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,580
think it looks brighter

125
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:08,880
I feel like actually no it does it

126
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,130
definitely does look brighter and it's

127
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,380
feel smoother too I think

128
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,820
bumps the bumps are still there the

129
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,910
bumps are where like the little hair

130
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,130
follicles are so they're still there but

131
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,490
they're much smoother now compared to

132
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,199
like this side can you see the

133
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,759
difference I don't know if you guys can

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,539
see the difference what if I like have

135
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,930
my armpits in me there's a super thirsty

136
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:37,229
it hasn't like magically bleached it or

137
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,870
anything but is a little bit brighter

138
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,729
definitely a little bit brighter I feel

139
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,460
like it's something you have to use like

140
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:46,680
very regularly to see more results but

141
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,699
yeah after one time I can see a very

142
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,449
slight difference yeah this side feels

143
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:56,820
pretty bumpy this side is really smooth

144
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:58,770
yeah there's definitely a difference

145
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,020
definitely a difference so I've just

146
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,300
zoomed out and I feel like you guys can

147
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,849
see the difference a bit better from a

148
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,789
distance this side is the one that I

149
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,130
haven't done anything to this side is

150
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:14,250
the one that I put the armpit right on

151
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,750
can you guys hear difference you know I

152
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,539
can't believe I'm showing the world my

153
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,270
underarms but it totally works I feel

154
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,789
like this side is maybe like half a

155
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,190
shade lighter than this side after just

156
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,289
one year and in regards to how it feels

157
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,259
this side definitely feels much more

158
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,380
smoother and this side is still pretty

159
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,030
rough and bumpy I'll do the other side

160
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,010
well do that in my own time

161
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:44,490
Leena let me just show you a before and

162
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:47,820
after photo okay so now it's time to

163
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,890
rate the product now considering it's a

164
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,780
very small tube and I think I bought it

165
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,300
online for maybe like fifteen or twenty

166
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,590
dollars I feel like I mean I feel like

167
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,720
they could have like given you a bit

168
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,150
more there's only 20 mils or product in

169
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,220
this when you do both underarms that's

170
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,840
already taken a lot of the product so I

171
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,360
don't know if you can use it a lot of

172
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,430
times another thing I didn't quite love

173
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,860
about the product is like removing it it

174
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,690
is pretty messy so I would recommend you

175
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,340
do it like over the bathroom sink or

176
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,780
something so at least all like the

177
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,490
powder can drop into the sink and you

178
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,150
can just wash it away because now it's

179
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:23,550
like literally on the floor also it is a

180
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,500
shoulder workout like my shoulder is

181
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,090
killing me right now I'm going to be saw

182
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,220
tomorrow and I'm yet to do this side

183
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,410
also another thing is when I took the

184
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,630
actual product off it was a little bit

185
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,190
itchy now don't know if it's like the

186
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,620
product or me just rubbing it with a

187
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,540
towel but it does like make you skin a

188
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,820
little bit itchy but it's not like

189
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,560
stinky it doesn't like really irritate

190
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,630
your skin much but then again I don't

191
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,120
have sensitive skin so if you have

192
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,520
sensitive skin I maybe do a patch test

193
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,760
to try it before just to see if you have

194
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,920
a reaction in terms of the results I do

195
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,170
like the results I just feel like I wish

196
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,910
it totally wounded it completely after

197
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,410
one go but I feel like you know if that

198
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,240
was the case they'd need very strong

199
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,670
like amount of like product oil

200
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,820
ingredients in there it does like

201
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,320
lighting it up about like half a shade

202
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,030
and I feel like it is something that

203
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,670
I'll just keep trying to see if it

204
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:16,410
lightens but after one use and like this

205
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:18,870
is my first impression I'm going to rate

206
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,160
it at eight and a half out of ten let me

207
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,440
know what you guys would rate this

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,760
product and if any of you guys like have

209
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,280
the same problem as me

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,770
sorry I'm not Ilona I just feel like

211
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,800
I've just I've just shown the world my

212
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,990
underarms so

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,940
let's do it

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,649

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,620

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,840
called best fiends forever so it's super

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,160
similar to the other best fiends games

20

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,730
stuff and big thinks the best fiends are

22

sponsoring this video so it's kind of

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,730
similar to the other ones but what's

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,760
different about it is it's more clicky

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,800

00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,945
- Her biggest phobia
is definitely spiders.

22
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:45,943
She's terrified.
- She's scared of spiders.

23
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:48,178
- One of them is, you know those stickers

24
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:50,596
that move, when you hold them?

25
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,180
They like change pictures.

26
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,354
Oh my gosh, please do not scratch those

27
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,752
in my presence, I can't handle the sound.

28
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,271
(record scratch)
It drives me nuts!

29
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,592
That, and filing your nails.

30
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:02,725
(throat gurgle)
And then I also don't like

31
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:05,305
drinking the milk at the
bottom of the carton.

32
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,296
Oh yeah, when people sneeze around me,

33
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,612
or cough, I have to hold my breath.

34
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,872
(sneeze)
Like I don't want to

35
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:13,876
drink in their snot, and
saliva, and grossness.

36
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,114
(throat gurgle)

37
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,472
- Definitely her eyes.

38
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:18,690
- Yeah, Bailey's best feature

39
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,463
- And her eyelashes.

40
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:20,173
is her eyes.

41
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:21,453
- And her hair.

42
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,594
- Hey, do you like my hair?

43
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,213
It's really soft.

44
00:01:25,213 --> 00:01:27,454
It's so light and fluffy.

45
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:29,660
- Her hair, she really likes her hair.

46
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,308
- My eyes.

47
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,015
And my eyelashes. (laughs)

48
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:35,256
Thanks dad. (laughs)

49
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,465
- Super sweet, and kind.

50
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:40,816
Definitely funny.

51
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,686
- Funny, charming.

52
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,083
He has to be a gentleman,
like that's number one.

53
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,116
- Black.

54
00:01:46,116 --> 00:01:47,132
- Yep.

55
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,453
- I would really like him to be

56
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:50,646
African American, because then we'd have

57
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:53,227
cute halfsie children, and
it's just really great.

58
00:01:53,227 --> 00:01:54,406
But, you know.

59
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,290
- A really tall person
(laughing)

60
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,920
to like make her.
- To balance out.

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,501
- Her kids kind of average.

62
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:02,660
- And, tall.

63
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,545
So, yeah.

64
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:09,359
- It takes her like an
hour to get dressed.

65
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,166
- It takes Bailey, at least an hour,

66
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,199
and that's not talking about hair,

67
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,682
or makeup. (in unison)

68
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:17,628
- It usually takes me about

69
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:20,783
20 to 30 minutes to get
ready in the morning.

70
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,443
- Picking out the right shoes.

71
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,999
- Everything, like the
closet, like on a weekend.

72
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,219
- Looks like a tornado came through.

73
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:30,343
- I don't know.

74
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:34,801
- I don't think Bailey
has a favorite TV show.

75
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,290
- Little House on the
Prairie, or Brady Bunch.

76
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,936
I like the oldies, okay?

77
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,846
I was like an oldies kid, but I can't,

78
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:43,462
I can't really think.

79
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:44,852
I can't really think of any.

80
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:46,535
Like, I don't know.

81
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:47,554
(camera click)

82
00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:49,545
- I think Bailey wants like
- Four.

83
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,317
- four or five kids.

84
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,223
- I probably want like four kids.

85
00:02:53,223 --> 00:02:55,539
But then again, like I could have seven

86
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,226
and be probably okay.

87
00:02:57,226 --> 00:02:58,709
I don't know, we'll see. (laughs)

88
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,105
- I know she's given me a list of names,

89
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:03,504
and I have them saved on my phone,

90
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:04,865
(laughing)
in my notes, because

91
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,551
she lost them them once.

92
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,770
(laughing)
She sent them to me

93
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,782
so that way if she ever lost them again

94
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,773
that someone would have them.

95
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:15,044
- But I have a whole list
of names on my phone.

96
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,933
And I can't remember
any of them right now,

97
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:18,721
but there's a whole list.

98
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:21,058
So I'm totally prepared
when I become a mother

99
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:23,943
because I've got the names ready to go.

100
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,445
- Maybe the peanut butter?

101
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:26,137
- The peanut butter one.

102
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:27,396
- With the.
- It has bananas in it?

103
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:29,224
- Bananas in it.

104
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:30,464
- My favorite kind of sandwich

105
00:03:30,464 --> 00:03:32,576
is chicken salad sandwiches.

106
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,726
- I don't think Bailey's
allergic to anything.

107
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:36,972
- Nothing.

108
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,179
- I'm allergic to (mumbling)

109
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:40,581
which is a kind of medicine.

110
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,064
And I'm also allergic to like

111
00:03:42,064 --> 00:03:43,833
lavendar drying sheets, which is what

112
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,966
you put in the dryer to make
your clothes smell good.

113
00:03:45,966 --> 00:03:48,973
And then I'm also, I think
I'm allergic to orange dye,

114
00:03:48,973 --> 00:03:51,310
like the flavoring in candy and stuff,

115
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,751
because everytime I eat them my tongue

116
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,682
gets really tingly and gross.

117
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:55,725
Yeah.

118
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:57,282
- I think she would love to work

119
00:03:57,282 --> 00:03:58,481
at like Disneyland, or something.

120
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,878
- She's addicted t o Disney princesses.

121
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,722
- She is in love and she has a phone case

122
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:06,506
that has a ton of all of the princesses.

123
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:07,826
- That Brooklyn gave to her, right?

124
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:08,517
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

125
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,346
- And she would be Rapunzel.

126
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,179
- With the.
- And she could be

127
00:04:11,179 --> 00:04:12,743
a Disney princess.
- With the

128
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:14,267
chopped hair.
- And, yeah.

129
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,100
- Yeah.

130
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,985
- My dream job is to be a writer

131
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,677
for Disney.

132
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,211
And I want to write the
Disney princess movies

133
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,583
because I have millions
of Disney princess ideas

134
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,981
for movies, and I love Disney princesses.

135
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,261
So my dream job would be

136
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,268
to become a Disney princess story writer.

137
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:34,096
- She has a scar on her knee.

138
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:36,412
- She was driving her sister's moped,

139
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:37,774
Camrey's moped.

140
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:40,130
And apparently she was going really fast

141
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,309
and she couldn't like.
- She just

142
00:04:41,309 --> 00:04:42,325
kind of

143
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,688
tipped over.
(laughing)

144
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,627
- I have a big scar on my knee.

145
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,679
And I got it from,

146
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,386
I was riding my sisters moped

147
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,275
and there's this giant
hill in our neighborhood

148
00:04:53,275 --> 00:04:55,612
and I was going way too fast down the hill

149
00:04:55,612 --> 00:04:57,440
and then it came around a curve

150
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,985
and I just
(crash)

151
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,508
I totally smashed into the ground

152
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,951
and scraped my knee.

153
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,414
Yeah, it was bad.

154
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,649
- Bailey was not named
after anyone, I don't think.

155
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,863
Not her first name, but
her middle name was.

156
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,789
- She was named after her great grandma,

157
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,455
or grandmother.

158
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:13,227
I can't remember.

159
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,116
But, her middle name is Marnay,

160
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,721
and grandma Marnay.

161
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,505
- I was named after no one.

162
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:21,049
But my middle name, Marnay,

163
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,532
was named after my grandma.

164
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,051
So, thanks grandma.

165
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,372
(camera click)

166
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,627
(upbeat music)

167
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:32,203
- The most boy crazy of the three of us

168
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:33,645
is probably.
- Definitely.

169
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,677
- Definitely.
- Faith! (in unison)

170
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:37,983
(laughing)
- Definitely Faith.

171
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:39,691
(laughing)
- In my defense,

172
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:42,236
boys are cute.
(laughing)

173
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,647
- I mean, she got a head start though.

174
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:46,091
(laughing)
- Hey!

175
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,878
I feel like Faith is
gonna come out of nowhere

176
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,138
and poor Mason Taylor.

177
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:51,067
Mason Taylor, okay, she's gonna become.

178
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:52,511
- She's the most talented person.

179
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,648
- She'll work on Broadway.

180
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:54,886
- The most talented
person I know, I swear.

181
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,776
- She's gonna become a
technician for Braodway.

182
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,543
I'll be a YouTuber.

183
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:00,061
And, this chick.

184
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:02,661
(laughing)

185
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,732
- Is gonna do something.

186
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,394
- Mason Taylor I feel like is most likely

187
00:06:07,394 --> 00:06:08,572
to fall asleep in school.

188
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:10,247
- I would say that, but
I fell asleep in both

189
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:13,071
Chemistry and English.
- Me too!

190
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,556
(laughing)
(crosstalk)

191
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,582
- I don't fall asleep at school, I can't.

192
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:18,801
I basically cannot.

193
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,137
Thank you guys so so much
for watching this video.

194
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:22,986
Comment below if you knew the answers

195
00:06:22,986 --> 00:06:24,408
to the questions about me.

196
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,298
Also, comment if you think Faith should

197
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,594
start a channel, because
she is contemplating this.

198
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:29,873
- Maybe I might.
- It's a very big decision

199
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:31,377
so we will see.

200
00:06:31,377 --> 00:06:32,576
- Don't forget to subscribe.

question you would most like answered by

68
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,299
a person or an all-knowing being or

69
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:56,340
device which of the following most

70
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,859

to hear this is such an intense oxygen

72
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:03,000
okay I got my question without a shadow

73
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,079
of a doubt never very soon it is

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,930
impossible

75
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,760
yes I will show you everything only if

76
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,400

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,579
once

79
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,950
if you want to forever not for many

80
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:19,139
years I'm gonna go with the first one

81
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,780
without a shadow of a doubt I want my

82
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:25,109
question to be answered without a shadow

83
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,060
of a doubt I most value freedom

84
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:30,990
individuality service or am

85
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,150
as between individual individuality or

86
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,140
omission it's the Ravenclaw Slytherin in

87
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,209
me fighting

88
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,600
I think individuality I think that's

89
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:44,709
what I most value I mean look at me my

90
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,920
beliefs are hard one who I am constantly

91
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,380
evolving you but strong see I feel like

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
few but strong and who I am is that's a

93
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,870
close close one what would you exchange

94
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,660
for your heart's desire it do see

95
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:01,570
anything that which I can afford to lose

96
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:04,510
the Lud's sweat and tears or what it is

97
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,880
worth what I exchange anything I don't

98
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,370
think so I think it's more like that

99
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,130
which I can afford to lose because I'd

100
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,350
be too anxious but caring everything my

101
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,600
best ideas get me in trouble

102
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,400

108
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,020
what a box

109
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,820
I think forget right if something is

110
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,740
like bothering me then I'll just keep

111
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,080
thinking about it so I could just be

112
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,850
able to let it go and forget about it

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,400
that'd be nice so I'm going to choose

114
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,830
forget I would most like to discover a

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,039

work unique or powerful I feel like my

159
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,160
magic would be unique I often think why

162
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,510

do that probably that one when will I

166
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,560
learn to keep my mouth shut

167
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,110
to say no to do things on time or the

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,220
secret it's to say no I say yes to

169
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,230
everything when will I learn to say no

171
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:10,980

160,15 DIY Halloween Costume Ideas for Best Friends or Couples | Brooklyn and Bailey,xgerx-qK7Cc,"Want to see 15 DIY Halloween Costumes that are perfect for couples, best friends, or your squad?? This is the perfect Halloween costume video for you! These are perfect last-minute DIY Halloween costumes for your Squad, BFF, or couples.  

Be sure to follow us on musical.ly @BrooklynAndBailey, and watch our funny music clips! http://www.musical.ly We are having so much fun on it!

This video definitely shows you awesome DIY Halloween costumes for girls, kids and teenagers as well as older Halloween lovers like parents, couples, and adults. First, we’ll show you our DIY Halloween Baseball Player costume, perfect for a last minute Halloween costume with stuff you likely already have! This DIY Halloween costume includes a baseball t-shirt, baseball hat, denim jeans, and some cute athletic socks. Pop in some bubble gum and you’re set! 
 
Next up, we show you our Peanut Butter & Jelly last-minute DIY Halloween Costume. How easy is this? We bought a brown shirt and a red shirt from Target and added some vinyl lettering to say “peanut butter” and “jelly”. 
 
What about a Pizza & Pizza Delivery Guy DIY Halloween Costume?  Bailey reused the same baseball tee and hat from our previous Baseball Player Costume and paired it with some ripped denim jeans, Converse, and a pizza box. Brooklyn wore an all black outfit with a DIY Halloween prop to look like a giant slice of pizza. Kamri tells you how to make the pizza slice in her video here: https://youtu.be/ybby956ynC8.
 
Next, we opted for a DIY Halloween Cop & Donut costume! We picked up the police outfit on Amazon and completed it with handcuffs. Bailey’s Halloween costume also uses a DIY Donut prop. Under the doughnut she wore an all white outfit to keep it clean and simple. She also opted for a simple hair bun Halloween hairstyle. Kamri also tells us how to make the donut in her video Here: https://youtu.be/ybby956ynC8.
 
We decided to do something for those people trick or treating on Halloween in threes… a DIY Halloween costume of the Three Blind Mice! We used matching black clothing from our closets and paired them with mouse ears, gloves, sunglasses, canes, and matching black bowties. Adding some fun Halloween makeup like bright red lipstick is a nice pop, too!
 
You may know of Elliot and Gertie, from the movie ET, who served as inspiration for our next costume! For Gertie’s DIY costume, you’ll need black overalls, striped shirt, sunflowers, & Reece’s Pieces. Cute pigtails with ribbons perfectly round out her costume. For Elliot, we use ripped jeans, red hoodie, and cute basket with an ET stuffed animal (wrapped up in blanket with his cute red heart showing thru). 
 
Our Google Maps Pin DIY Halloween costume is up next! Grab a grey t-shirt, add yellow duct tape, and printed street names and destinations.  We also cut out giant red poster board pins to wear on our faces. This couples costume is ADORABLE! 
 
The DIY Piñata & Birthday Boy is also a cute Halloween costume idea! We found birthday supply items from Walmart and wore them as decorations. We cut the edges of felt to create a piñata fringe look and then hot glued that all to a dress we bought. We also used two Styrofoam cones and added the fringe there as well to create a cheap and inexpensive DIY piñata headband.
 
Superheroes create a cute look and are definitely a last minute Halloween costume option since it only requires a couple superhero t-shirts, denim shorts, some cute socks and shoes, and a bow to match the shirts. Brooklyn opted for a Superman t-shirt and Bailey picked a Batman t-shirt for this last minute Halloween costume. 
 
This year Pokemon is all the rage, so why not create couples Halloween costumes of Pikachu & Ash Ketchum? We bought Pikachu ears and tail from Amazon and paired it with a yellow tee and socks. Bailey wore a cute Ash Ketchum baseball hat with a simple white tee and jeans!
 
Our DIY Scuba Diver costumes are our personal favorites! We created our DIY scuba gear out of 2 liter soda bottles, black tubing, pacifiers, and fun foam to create the belt. We added DIY flippers out of fun foam to fit over our shoes and some snorkeling masks and headed out to sea!

If you loved this video, please give it a HUGE ""👍🏼"", and comment below with which couples costumes you loved the most!

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,360
hi guys welcome my channel today

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,840
I am going  to share with you guys on   how

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:41,040
you can get baby soft feet easily at

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,240
use one or twice per week

5
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,140
first step  which   is deep cleansing for

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,500
this you just need any regular body wash 
I am going to use the   British Rose range

7
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,320
need a small  soaking tub or a basin  with

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:22,320
warm water enough to   soak your feet in 
it make   sure  to remove any existing nail

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,280
polish now soak your feet   in the soapy 
water for about   10 minutes and it's very

10
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,480
important to relax while you do this 
whole treatment distract your mind by 
doing  something  that you love what I

11
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:47,920
like doing is playing games these   days I

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,520
now back to the treatment  it's been 
almost  10  minutes now and it's time to 
scrub away those dead skins use your

13
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,200
chemic stone to scrub down   the  calluses 
on the heel and ball of your foot 
you shouldn't scrub too roughly gentle

14
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:16,000
buffing on the surface with little or no 
pressure is the best

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,120
remove your feet from the soaking tub 
and empty the soapy   water completely  dry 
your feet off using a clean towel now on

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
to the second step   which is feet soaking

17
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,360
take clean warm  water in a soaking tub 
and add  four teaspoons of salt into   it 
and also add two   teaspoons of apple

18
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,440
cider vinegar into the water, now soak 
your feet into  the water this soaking

19
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,200
solution will remove any bad order from

20
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:10,320
your feet help heal fungus or ingrown 
nails and soothe dry skin apple cider

21
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:19,760
vinegar  has antifungal antiseptic  and 
antimicrobial properties that fight

22
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,360
against  the fungus on the foot it 
balances the pH levels of the  skin to 
relieve you from itching  and burning

23
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:45,520
clean the inside of your nails using one

24
00:03:46,080 --> 00:04:03,040
of the attachment in   the nail clipper as 
shown in the video

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:16,960
Here I am also using a razor   to  remove 
any unwanted hair  from the feet  remove

26
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,560
remove your feet from the soaking tub and
emptied out completely dry your feet off 
using a clean towel

27
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:34,800
now file your nails using a nail filer

28
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,320
now  onto the third  step which is foot

29
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,120
need three tablespoons   of grinded  oats

30
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,480
and 2 TSP milk mix both of   them together very well

31
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
now apply it throughout your feet scrub

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:12,080
gently to remove  dead skins and  smooth 
in your skin oat means 
grainy little slaves perform super skin

33
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,240
exfoliation oatmeal removes dead cells 
and can   even get rid  of   irritation and 
redness after a good oatmeal scrub your

34
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:37,440
feet will  be left soft and glowing  after 
scrubbing  your feet for a good   5 minutes 
leave it as a food mask for 10 to 15  minutes

35
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,120
after 15   minutes just wash it  off with 
lukewarm water and remember   to gently

36
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,240
rub it in circular motion your feet is

37
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,720
going to feel baby soft   after using  this 
mask remove your feet from the soaking

38
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,480
tub and  empty it out  completely dry your  feet of using a clean towel now on to

39
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,640
step 5 which is moisturizing

40
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,480
here I  am going to use one 
of the body butter from the body shop

41
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:21,360
moisturizing your feet is really 
important because it helps to keep your 
skin hydrated

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,360
last but not least you can paint your

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,760
nails using your favorite nail polish   so

first time I played this one of

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,919
embarrassed to say that I played it for

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,869

10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:26,849

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,730
alright let's make our character i want

18
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,710

19
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,230

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,600
side a real hard time finding love

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,220
so we can get a farm that basically lets

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,190
you specialize in some of the ways you

23
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,720
can earn money wilderness farm says at

24
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,510
night the monsters come out that could

25
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,330
be cool a hilltop farm is rocky terrain

26
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,340
and a winding river make it difficult to

27
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,580
design your farm however a mineral

28
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,520
deposit provides binding opportunities

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,789

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,829

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
what's up guys David here and these

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,210
three phones are arguably the best

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,519
Android smartphones in the world right

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,590
now and for very different reasons

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,509
you've got the Galaxy s7 edge which in

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,880
my opinion has the best Hardware package

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,389
on any smart phone including the iPhone

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,039
7

9
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,720
you've got the pixel excel which has the

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,510
latest version of Android straight from

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
Google and then you have the one plus 3t

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,039
which is probably the best smartphone in

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,960
the world dollar-for-dollar so in

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,849
today's video we're gonna put all three

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,040
in a speed test to see how each stacks

16
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,020
up when it comes to performance but

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,329
before we do I want to give a big

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,280
shout-out to best fiends for sponsoring

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,870
today's video so I actually have it

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,790
installed my phone here so we're gonna

21
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,350
check out the game best means forever is

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,450
the second game in the Best Fiend

23
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,180
trilogy with the same characters and

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,039
story but it's a totally brand new and

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,320
different kind of game this is an

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,379
addictive clicker adventure game where

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,420
you slap tap and pretty much try to

28
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,280
upgrade everything in the game while

29
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,590
also trying to get as far as you can as

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
fast as you can and starting with this

31
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,580
update they're introducing new limited

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,950
time events where you can win special

33
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,720
rewards and it all starts off with slugs

34
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,159
in space so be sure to connect the game

35
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,080
to Facebook so you can compete against

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,689
your friends and download the game for

37
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,490
free at the first link down below in the

38
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,150
description all right let's get to the

39
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,220
speed test

40
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,200
so we'll kick things off by starting to

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,030
stopwatches on each phone and then head

42
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,090
right into the first row of system apps

43
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,740
where the 1 + 3 T and the pixel XL jump

44
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,930
ahead of the galaxy s7 with there

45
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,060
quicker animations with both phones now

46
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,130
neck and neck as they work on Photoshop

47
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,200
mix where it looks like the 3t has a

48
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,119
split second lead over the pixel as it

49
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,619
starts working on vid trim where all

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,990
three phones will have to transcode the

51
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,579
same exact video file and what's

52
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,350
interesting here is the pixel has

53
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,049
actually made up some ground on the 1 +

54
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,119
3 T here in vid trim with both homes now

55
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,549
neck neck once again as they start

56
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,619
working on subway surfers meanwhile the

57
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,270
galaxy s7 is lagging behind a bit

58
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,130
finally finishing with vid trim and

59
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,950
joining the other two in the gaming row

60
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,869
but now almost a full app behind just

61
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,310
over halfway through this first lab so

62
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,229
at least for this first lap it looks

63
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,629
like the real competition is between the

64
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,310
1 + 3 T and the Google pixel where

65
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,460
neither phone has really been able to

66
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,190
jump out ahead of the

67
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,440
and grab a definitive lead but that may

68
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,600
just change here and fit the fat with

69
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,150
the 1 + 3 T and it's higher clocked

70
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,040
Snapdragon 820 one chip pulling ahead of

71
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,140
the Google pixel and finishing up with

72
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,270
fit to fats as it moves on to the last

73
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,490
game in this game hero in smash hit

74
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,750
however the pixel XL is still right

75
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,790
there behind it so there's still a

76
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,070
chance for it to make a comeback but a

77
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,290
comeback by the galaxy s7 at this point

78
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,150
is probably not in the cards with it

79
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,010
falling further and further behind in

80
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,210
this first lap and based on the tests

81
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,880
that we've done so far in the past

82
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:48,040
things probably won't get any better in

83
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,810
the second lap speaking of which the 3t

84
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,100
is about to enter the second lap as it

85
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,770
finishes the last leg of the first

86
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,110
clocking in a time of 1 minute and 30

87
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,820
seconds with the pixel XL finishing just

88
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,240
6 seconds later with a time of 1 minute

89
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,550
and 36 so here we go the 1 + 3 T and

90
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,620
it's whopping 6 gigabytes of RAM is just

91
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,750
flying through this second lap having

92
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,700
all the apps including the games ready

93
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,190
to go in the background as it inches

94
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,250
closer and closer to lapping the galaxy

95
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,920
s7 will it do it and yes the 1 + 3 T

96
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,200
laughs the galaxy s7 finishing both laps

97
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,330
at a time of 1 minute and 53 seconds

98
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,180
while the galaxy s7 finishes just the

99
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,590
first lap in 1 minute and 55 so we'll go

100
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,510
ahead and fast-forward the other two

101
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,310
phones to the finish line where after

102
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,680
only keeping a few of the ABS ready to

103
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,470
go the pixel XL finishes with a total

104
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,510
time of 2 minutes and 57 seconds and the

105
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,940
galaxy s7 just struggles all the way

106
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,580
through finishing with a total time of 3

107
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,040
minutes and 51 seconds making the winner

108
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,370
and Android speedtest champ

109
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,980
the 1 + 3 T that is it for me in this

110
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,170

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,069
hey guys it's Brianna and today I'm

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,480
going to be doing my morning routine

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:08,790
since getting married my mind and

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,830
routine has definitely changed so I

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,349
thought I would do an updated one I

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,420
normally always wake up first and I

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,449
usually plan my phone for about 30

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,910
minutes before waking Jaylin up so first

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,600
I'll check my emails and reply to them

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,119
then I like to go on Instagram and give

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,670
hearts to every single picture in my

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,219
feed because I just love to spread love

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,860
after that I'll get on my YouTube app

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,780
and catch up with some videos I was just

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,940
watching my good friend Kelly kaisers

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,890
new video you guys should go subscribe

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,290
to her because she's almost at a hundred

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,969
thousand subscribers seriously go

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,600
subscribed her if you like my videos

20
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,300
you'll love hers then I was watching my

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,719
faves acacia and Jarius and catching up

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,969
on their most recent vlog and then once

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,399
I'm done watching videos I'll go to my

24
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:02,100
most recent video and I replied to as

25
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,080
many comments as I can and after that

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,869
I'll check out all the new snapchat

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,000
stories then I'll check Twitter and see

28
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,310
what's going on with you guys and once

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,439
I'm all up to date with my social medias

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,110
I like to play this cool game called

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,020
best fiends and I actually partnered

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,420
with them on this video it's basically a

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,220
puzzle battle game and you collect a ton

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,430
of cute little characters they're so

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,220
adorable and you make them into a team

36
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,530
to defeat the slugs I freaking hate the

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,140
slugs and my favorite thing to do is

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,299
defeat them I freaking hate them they're

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,310
seriously a ton of different levels you

40
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,560
can play and on top of that there's

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,600
special side quests and they're kind of

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,220
like based on the cute little characters

43
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
which i think is so cute and there's

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,329
also a summer update that which is

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,369
awesome I'm on level 51 well in this

46
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,460
video I was on level 51 but now I'm on

47
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,860
level 55 if you think you can pass my

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,860
level tweet me your scores and what

49
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,860
level you're on and I will battle you

50
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,530
also there's a free gift on Father's Day

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,840
which is June 19th and you can get it by

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,819
logging in that day click the link down

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,640
below to download the best fiends app

54
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,170
for free once I'm done with my phone aka

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,450
two hours later

56
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,670
I wake up Jalen with a bunch of kisses

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,880
to give him a good start to his morning

58
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,820
and then he puts a shirt on not normally

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,820
but in the video he did and we head over

60
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,740
to the kitchen to eat some breakfast

61
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,200
normally we eat avocado toast but we

62
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,480
were out of avocados because I like to

63
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,550
eat them all so we just had some apples

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,680
for the video once we're done in the

65
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,780
kitchen Jalen normally gets started with

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,820
work well normally he actually gets

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,320
ready but I didn't film him getting

68
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,020
ready like he'll take a shower do all

69
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,680
that stuff but just pretend he already

70
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,720
did that

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,700
so I get ready differently every single

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,640
day depending on if I'm making a video

73
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,100
or editing but this is basically what I

74
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,150
do every morning I first brush my teeth

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:03,320
and then I turn on music and this is

76
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,320
what goes down

77
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,330
ah

78
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:44,660
after I'm done with my makeup jam

79
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,580
session I head over to my closet I first

80
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,340
plug in my phone of course because it

81
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,080
always dies in the morning because I

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,120
don't charge it at night and then after

83
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,220
I plug it in I pick out my outfit for

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,250
the day I normally stare at my clothes

85
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,110
for 15 minutes not even exaggerating and

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,360
then I'll finally come up with an outfit

87
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,700
and try it on and decide um I don't

88
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,950
really want to wear this today so and

89
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,380
I'll come up with a new outfit and

90
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,209
decide mmm not this one either

91
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,520
and I literally repeat that process

92
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,860
about seven times before I find the

93
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,830
right one in today's outfit my shirt is

94
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,810
from boohoo and my shorts are by one tsp

95
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,210
once I'm done getting dressed I head

96
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,000
over to the office to join Jalen because

97
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,400
we both work from home and we start our

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,200
days so that's it for my morning routine

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,910

End music: Thursday and Snow (Reprise) by Blank & Kytt","1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
I was on the phone to my mom the other

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,160
day and I was saying to her how it just

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,099
feels like time is going so much faster

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:15,230
as I'm getting older and she's like yeah

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:17,279
that happens I'm like why is it me ah

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,590
these favorites videos are getting

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,680
longer and longer every month and so

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,470
let's just get into it but first up in

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,220
April I read Murano Festo by Catelyn

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,650
Moran

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,330
only love Catelyn Moran I think she's

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,940
great also from carrying this around all

13
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,469
month I've just ruined the cover its

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,320
disgusting now this is basically

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,360
Caitlyn's political manifesto of what

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,149
she wants the world to be like it is

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,539
mostly a lot of her columns from over

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,280
the last few years in book form so if

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,890
you've read most of her columns from The

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,510
Times online then you've probably read

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,030
most of this book anyway there's just

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,680
like a few other extra things for the

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,270
book I really enjoyed it her writing is

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,920
always really really funny although it

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,800
is a massive book and a bit awkward to

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,010
lug around at times graffiti and other

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,350
poems by Savannah brown Savannah is a

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,460
youtuber she is a friend of mine and she

29
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,770
is self-published

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,659
this little book of poems and it's

31
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,700
illustrated by Deb stockin I'm not

32
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,020
massively a poetry person but I loved

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,600
reading this because I just had to

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,100
Savannah's voice in my head as I was

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,840
reading it all it's absolutely wonderful

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,659
and I know that Savannah has worked

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,670
really hard on this and I'm so proud of

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,100
her and then finally an April I read

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,570
mind your head by Juno Dawson it's super

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,700
easy to read and has like loads of

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,720
diagrams and illustrations in it I think

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,150
it is a great mental health 101 book for

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,890
all ages it's got loads of facts in it

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,509
but it's also really reassuring and I

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,799
definitely think it's helping breaking

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,720
down the stigma around mental health

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,570
this next favorite is sponsored is the

48
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,369
app best fiends they got in touch and I

49
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,040
knew about them already because Dodie

50
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,659
has been playing their game constantly

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,290
and so I downloaded it being like okay

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,790
what is this and yes I'm now addicted I

53
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,469
was meant to film this video this

54
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,570
morning but I didn't because I was

55
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,880
procrastinating all morning just lying

56
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,860
in bed playing the game you have these

57
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,690
little bugs and you have to defeat the

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,540
evil slugs that have taken over the

59
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,530
world by matching together the same

60
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,510
colored

61
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,490
little icons then you can collect

62
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,290
rewards which help you grow your little

63
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,660
creatures and evolve so they can become

64
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,410
more powerful what level am I on I'm on

65
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,950
level 44 but I've been stuck on that

66
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:31,709
level for so long I can't get past it I

67
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,260
think I'm just gonna go back to easier

68
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,150
levels and get all of the points so I

69
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,520
can evolve my creatures and make them

70
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,470
stronger so I can beat level 44 so

71
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,140

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,600

like taken back into the magic of

127
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,430
childhood but it was also like really

128
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,650
scary then little Boyle Neel Sethi who

129
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,960
plays Mowgli it was just absolutely

130
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,860
adorable it's so cute but also just

131
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,270
really good like he had to act - nothing

132
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,710
like he wasn't reacting to anything he

133
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,720
was just on a green screen with all

134
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,520
these big fake creatures

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,600
I mean I'm impressed the cast of that

136
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,910
was incredible and just the CGI amazing

137
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,660
and my heart was thumping the whole way

138
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,500
through yep

139
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,570
turn America Civil War I love Marvel

140
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,000
films I love The Avengers I was a bit

141
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,919
nervous about Civil War because of

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,990
spider-man being in it and I love

143
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,390
spider-man and I was like is it gonna be

144
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,070
good as the new guy playing him gonna be

145
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,470
good is he gonna do spider-man justice

146
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,260
and oh my god yes spider-man isn't in it

147
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,780
for that much but when he is in it his

148
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,320
dialogue is spot-on they just use him

149
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,260
perfectly to set him up for the next

150
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,160
spider-man film another person who's

151
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,960
brilliantly set up was Black Panther

152
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,030

[Music]

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,330
edgy but you can't draw a perfect circle

25
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:31,430
freehand over time it was really hard I

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:34,700
can do it but no go away what do you

27
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,600
think of this I try windy let me show

28
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,240
you how to do it dry a perfect circle

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,399
freehand is pretty much impossible the

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,409
trick is to place your fifth knuckle on

31
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,539
the paper and then rotate the paper

32
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,890
around the knuckle as the rest of your

33
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,229
hands stay still

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,179
kind of like a compass this way you'll

35
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,270
get your perfect circle without using

36
00:01:53,179 --> 00:02:07,940
any other tools

[Applause]

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:28,750
it's really good

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:30,430
Facebook perfect circle cool huh hey

41
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,530
wing gee I bet you can't stand on your

42
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,300
left leg yeah Chad that's easy

43
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,270
no besides catch you got to have your

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:44,670
left shoulder on the wall first oh okay

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:44,670
let me give it a good right

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:56,830
[Music]

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:03:00,520
so much magnet here or something what

48
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:03,100
let me give you what I do it okay my bad

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,020
is actually impossible let me tell you

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,940
why this set seems like it would be

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,340
super easy at first until you actually

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,739
try it out for yourself they know seems

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,420
strangely impossible the reason you

54
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,520
won't ever be able to do this is because

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,100
when you stand on one leg your center of

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,170
gravity shifts towards that leg and then

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,840
your body needs to compensate by moving

58
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,940
in that same direction unfortunately in

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,739
this case there's a wall in the way so

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:37,870
no matter what you do you won't be able

61
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:39,700
to keep balance hey maybe I been you can

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,709
take this class and put it on the side

63
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,140
of the truck and then fellas this coin

64
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:48,650
on the other side and have it like solid

65
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:52,229
hey all right try it stupid

68
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:17,830
no really possible not is it okay the

69
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,590
trick to winning to set is to use water

70
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,720
normally the coin is much too heavy to

71
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,370
be able to balance on the card but if

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,170
you fill the cup full of water so that

73
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,360
the surface of the water comes into

74
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:30,940
contact with the card you'll be able to

75
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,950
balance the coin easily the reason this

76
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,320
works is because the surface tension of

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,870
the water once in contact with the card

78
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,150
exerts a pulling force downward with

79
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,250
counteract the weight of the coin this

80
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,080
is actually quite strong and the more

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,310
surface area of the card that is in

82
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,320
contact with the water

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:54,550
the stronger the cloth and the heavier

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:58,930
the coin it can hold these so she wasn't

85
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:05,710
impossible fine

86
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:09,400
you in this one you gave back elbow

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:14,680
table try for that good hair don't pin

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,750
it on the fine Oh sister ski okay to

89
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,360
drink for you you want it oh really

90
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,360
which is sweet thank you

91
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:34,840
breath drink from this oh you want to

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,840
know why why would you do this

93
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,240
jeez you can totally prank your friends

94
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,070
with this trick physically because one

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,530
sure is opening and the other is

96
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,170
underwater you will only be a suck in

97
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,060
air from the open straw this happens

98
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:53,220
because the air travels through the path

99
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,020
of least resistance whereas the water is

100
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,570
denser than air and then what is the

101
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,580
route up the other straw however you can

102
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,730
overcome this resistance if you've slept

103
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,790
really vigorously or if you cheat like I

104
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,790
do

hey many hustlers tiny sketching paper

107
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,640
into this flow okay easy

108
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,100
well the rules are you can do whatever

109
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,870
you want with a bottle but you just

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,060
can't touch this with your hand and put

111
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,370
it into the bottle let me give it a go

112
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,880
alright look so easy do it that's right

113
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,880
in there

114
00:06:38,370 --> 00:07:15,090
oh yeah Club do it anymore I feel so

115
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,080
lightheaded this is impossible

116
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:21,120
it's possible I sure you have there's a

117
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,460
reason why you can't blow a bowl of

118
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,710
paper into the bottle opening and this

119
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,930
is because as you blow the air into the

120
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,520
bottle it must also escape through the

121
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,770
bottle opening as well

122
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,960
this causes a jet of air to push the

123
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,120
paper ball back out so no matter what

124
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,820
you do the reverse air jet will never

125
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,590
allow the paper to go in the only way to

126
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,870
win this particular bet is to let

127
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,910
gravity help you by placing the bottle

128
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,710
upright and under the top surface of

129
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,780
your table you can blow the piece of

130
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,980
paper off the table and then let gravity

131
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:57,139
do the work as it drops right in

acted one where I am a superpower yeah I

136
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:23,580
can turn me down the stroller have to

137
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,419
pay or clean straight through what no

way

139
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:42,300
let me try what this is impossible and

140
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:45,409
what makes a group out anyway and I'll

141
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,409
show you how it's done

142
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,560
unfortunately for me I don't have

143
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,810
superpowers the secret to this trick is

144
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,880
actually quite simple in order to piece

145
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,490
the solid potato with a simple plastic

146
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,529
straw simply cover the top of the straw

147
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,019
with your finger and then stab it right

148
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,790
through this compresses the air within

149
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,300
the straw and helps give the slide

150
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:11,880
strength as you stab it into the potato

151
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,040
which sounds really violence without

152
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,720
your finger over the hole the air would

153
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,050
escape and the straw would just end up

158
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:39,310
do it I get super money right sure there

159
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,379
are a few rules one can only touch the

160
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:44,889
no you can touch the bottle and if the

161
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:47,279
bottle falls over view it all right done

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:51,180

my very money let me show you how it's

168
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,350
done

169
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:22,600
this that requires some lateral thinking

170
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,850
the problem is if you try and move the

171
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,189
notes slowly the bottle just move with

172
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,680
it if you try to move the note quickly

173
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:31,540
the bottle falls over the trip is to

174
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,430
roll the note up and then use the role

175
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,449
note to move the bottle of gently and

176
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,189
carefully

you haven't cheated because you haven't

178
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:46,350
touched the bottle and now you get to

179

and I bet that you can't afford to

183
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,480
exactly half way without a measuring cup

184
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,820
try it

185
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,020
Oh what okay Wendy I don't even know why

186
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:24,390
you're making me do this

187
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:26,670
but own a whole Accords too much up I'm

188
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:28,860
really confused right now let me show

189
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,720
you this that seems pretty hard to pull

190
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,820
off with just using your eyes to get the

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,250
water level of the secret is actually

192
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,560
pretty easy if the cup is shaped like a

193
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,690
cylinder you can perfectly tip out half

194
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,580
the water by tipping the top to the side

195
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,950
and pouring out the water so that the

196
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,740
level runs from one corner to the other

197
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,380
on regular leash a p-- cups this is

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,170
exactly the halfway point now the next

199
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,190
question is is the glass half full and

200
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,190

win more often in rock-paper-scissors

208
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,430
not necessarily just a game of chance

209
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,800
actually a lot of research has gone into

210
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,500
this game and in fact and I didn't know

211
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,940
this there are professional

212
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,860
rock-paper-scissors tournament cells but

213
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,930
almost no professional players like you

214
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,640
and I gives a few tricks to increase our

215
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,800
chances of winning the first thing you

216
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,720
need to do is make it a surprise and not

217
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,880
give your opponents any time think about

218
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,350
some vanmoof next if they're male play

219
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,360
paper because most males actually

220
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,329
default to rock and if your approach

221
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,860
female play rock as most females default

222
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,149
this business there are a whole lot of

223
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,250
other tricks that you guys can learn

224
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,050
online as well we took these out on your

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,280

226
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,670

hey rainy every continent is catch a

229
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,000
packet to the bottom of the bottle

230
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,760
why are you trying to picture pack it in

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,820
a bottle anyway anyway so the role of

232
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,750
are you can't tip the bottle upside down

233
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:48,310
and can't pull the water out okay

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:50,560
alright I give up let me show you how

235
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,630
the trick to this set is squeezing the

236
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,430
water bottles but why does squeezing the

237
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,560
bottle cause the ketchup packets to sink

238
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,570
to the bottom the answer again has to do

239
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,280
with air molecules either you guys are

240
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,870

173,Stephen Sharer - Share the Love (Official Music Video),AoXppCgaBSk,"Share the Love - Original Song by Stephen Sharer ft. Carter Sharer and Lizzy Sharer

🎶 GET THE TRACK 🎶
▶︎ ITUNES (https://goo.gl/fyqRES)
▶︎ SPOTIFY (https://goo.gl/ZGHjjw)

Today Stephen Sharer, Carter Sharer, and Liz decided to make the most epic music video vlog ever. Stephen and Carter ran outside to get things started. Stephen started by modding Nerf guns to make them stronger. Carter then stepped things up a notch and pulled out the Worlds Largest Nerf rocket launcher. Stephen then gave the Worlds Largest Fidget Spinner a huge spin. Then Carter climbed in the skid steer machine, Stephen jumped in the pool.  Carter dumped the huge bucket full of Orbeez and made a huge Orbeez waterfall all over Stephen. Then Carter hopped on his mountain bike and rode down the hill and hit the huge mega ramp and just like in the Roman Atwood Backflip Challenge, Carter did an epic backflip into the pond. Carter then rode on the Worlds biggest hoverboard and to top it off he did an epic wheelie on his dirt bike. Now it was Liz’s turn to make things epic.  Liz started off by running on water and across the pond. She then filled up a huge water balloon on the trampoline and climbed inside. Then Stephen and Carter bounced her and the huge water balloon on the trampoline. Then Carter popped the giant water balloon while Liz was flying through the air on the trampoline. Then Stephen, Carter, and Liz ran down to the pond and climbed on the floating water trampoline. All at once they jumped off and did a backflip into the water. To top it off the Sharer's all climbed in a lime green Lamborghini and drove off into the sunset. If you thought this was the most epic vlog ever then comment #MusicVideo and smash the like button. 

This music video and song captures the spirit of the Stephen Sharer channel and consolidates the positive message to help spread love around the world, Share the Love. 

😊 This channel is family-friendly and kid-friendly, so everyone can join in on the fun! Share The Love!! 😊🤘

This gift is also very affordable, since you can get a plain sweater for very cheap. If you are making the DIY project for yourself feel free to use your old sweater and give it a new life. DIY projects that include recycling clothes are always so much fun!
 
One of my favorite DIY gifts is a picture frame. Buy a cheap picture frame and decorate it yourself. You can color the frame and stick flowers or other decorations on it. Great DIY Christmas gift or a birthday present all year around. This is a pretty DIY room décor that you can make for yourself too.

Ear hats are a huge trend and can be such a cute Christmas gift! I show how you can make them yourself for very cheap. This is one of the cutest DIY projects I have ever tried. You guys know how I love DIY clothes projects. If I happen to give my hat away as a present, I will definitely recycle one of my old hats and make one for myself.
 
As cute little DIY inexpensive gifts you can make bonbons full of yummy candy. Using a paper roll and some wrapping paper you can package candy into adorable bonbons. Such a pretty gift idea for anyone you love. You can also use these as stocking fillers!
 
You don’t have to be a cooking expert to make delicious chocolate bonbons. All you need for this adorable gift idea is some chocolate, molds and sprinkles. You can also make healthy chocolates by topping them with dried fruits or chopped nuts.

Beauty DIY gift ideas are perfect DIY presents for beauty enthusiasts! I show you how to make a moisturizing DIY scrub. I added some peppermint extract so this one really smells like Christmas. The main ingredients you need are coconut oil and sugar. I love using this DIY scrub myself. Especially in the winter when my skin gets dry this DIY scrub removes dead skin cells and moisturizes like a dream!
 
Room decorations are great as DIY gift ideas for any age. I show  how to make easy DIY clay bowls, which can be used as decorating and organizing pieces. You can use them to store  jewelry, keys, pins or other small bits and pieces. These DIY presents are also so much fun to make!
 
DIY mugs can be an awesome gift for Christmas, birthday, or any other occasion. You can be so creative with designs – write on some funny or inspiring quotes, draw pictures and just have fun creating these awesome DIY gifts.

00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,870
In this video I will show you ten adorable
gift ideas that everyone would love to receive.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,130
These are perfect for Christmas, birthdays
or any other occasion. Investing time and

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,750
thought in presents is really what turns a
little present in something big and meaningful,

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,480
because it shows that besides the object you're
also giving a lot of love.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,140
Hey loves! December is just around the corner
and I'm so excited about the Christmas lights,

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,960
yummy food and hanging out with friends and
family. But this is also the time when we

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,620
stress out about the Christmas gifts. But
don't you worry, guys, because I've got you

8
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,039
covered. In this video I'm going to show you
ten affordable and epic DIY Christmas gift

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,160
ideas that you can make for your loved ones.
These are also perfect for birthday presents

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,949
all year around and of course you can totally
just DIY them for yourself. I'm not going

11
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,579
to lie, I'm probably keeping one, two or five
gifts for myself. Okay, I hope you guys are

12
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,119
excited, take your crafty spirits out and
let's get started.

13
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,960
For someone that loves ice cream and deserts,
an ice cream sundae box is a perfect gift!

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,009
To make it you need a gift box and a bunch
of ice cream related things like cones, cups

15
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:21,930
and toppings like candy, sprinkles, honey,
ice cream scoop, little spoons and decorations.

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,840
Now we have to package everything nicely.
For the cones, take some cellophane and roll

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,790
it like that to make a cone shape. Secure
it with a piece of tape. Put in a few ice

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:39,900
cream cones and make a bow on top using ribbon.
Pretty cute, right?! Next let's make three

19
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,170
little bags of sprinkles. Here I have blue
colored sugar. I also have this beautiful

20
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:53,810
colorful confetti. Yum! In the third bag I'll
pour a bunch of pearl confetti. To decorate

21
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,590
the bags cut a small piece of colored cardboard
paper, fold it in half and punch it on the

22
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,380
bag with stapler. This makes the bags look
so festive and pretty. I think packing the

23
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,670
cone and toppings into the DIY packages adds
so much to this gift box. Fill the box with

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,720
other ice cream related goodies like this
ice cream scoop. You can fill the handle with

25
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,690
sprinkles! When you make yourself an ice cream
you can quickly add some sprinkle yummines

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,640
on top of it. So cool, right? I also got these
three little jars, which I decided to fill

27
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,410
in with some sugar covered chocolate candy,
gummy worms and honey. You can use different

28
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,480
dressings like chocolate or caramel sauce.
And of course besides candy you can use chocolate

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,450
chips, crushed cookies or chopped nuts, dried
fruits and chopped dark chocolate for a bit

30
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,849
healthier options. Just think about the favorite
snacks of the person the box is for. I'm adding

31
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:48,090
two little notes in the box as well. On the
first one I wrote Ice cream sundae in a box

32
00:02:48,090 --> 00:03:02,909
and on the other, bon appetit and I added
a raffia hanger to both. To make sure the

33
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,980
spoons won't scatter all around the box, let's
tie them together and make a bow. We are finally

34
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,370
ready to put all these goodies into the box!
I think it looks extra cute if you add some

35
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,200
tissue paper on the bottom – I scrunched
two pink pieces and popped them in. You can

36
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,840
make so many different thematic sundae boxes.
If you're making it for someone that eats

37
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,909
very healthy you can put in a bunch of different
yogurt toppings, like granola, crushed nuts,

38
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:32,950
seeds and so on. The options are endless.
I think an ice cream sundae box like this

39
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,599
will put a big smile on the face of whoever
you'll give it to.

40
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,569
Pimping up plain clothes is a great way to
make amazing gifts at affordable price. Here,

41
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:46,330
I transformed a plain sweater into the most
adorable cat sweater everyone would love.

42
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,500
All you need to make it is a plain sweater
that you can get for very cheap, scissors,

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,220
pink and black felt, ribbon and fabric glue.
Start by outlining the animal you are going

44
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:03,830
for. I decided to make a cat so I need a pair
of pointy ears, eyes, nose, mouth and whiskers.

45
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,489
Cut all the shapes out. Be creative and make
other animals of your choice, like a dog or

46
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:22,530
bear for example, you can have so much fun
designing the sweater. For the nose I am cutting

47
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,160
a little pink heart from a light pink piece
of felt, just to make our kitty cat sweater

48
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,570
even more cute. Here's how it looks when we
put all the pieces together. Hmm... something

49
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,240
is missing – a little pink bow, so let's
quickly make one from a piece of ribbon. Place

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,759
the ribbon around the pointer and the middle
finger and lead the bottom end up and through

51
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,250
the opening between the two fingers. Tie both
ribbon ends together in a knot. Take the bow

52
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,540
off your fingers, trim away the excess ribbon
and you are done. These ribbons can be used

53
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,870
for so many DIY projects but today we are
using one as a fashionable accessory to our

54
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,199
kitten. All we have to do now is glue the
pieces onto the sweater. Fabric glue is completely

55
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:11,120
washable and should last many years. I am
so pleased with how this cat sweater turned

56
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
out! Making a present like this is so much
better than just buying a fancy expensive

57
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,970
piece of clothing in a store. It really shows
that you took time and put effort into creating

58
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,780
a present for someone you love. Plus it's
way cheaper for you! This is such a fun and

59
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,590
easy diy project that you can totally make
for yourself as well.

60
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,840
A great Christmas or birthday gift idea for
any age is this beautiful picture frame. You

61
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,370
need an inexpensive picture frame, acrylic
paint, paint brush, glue and some fake flowers.

62
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,830
Fancy picture frames can be quite expensive,
while you can get such plain ones for a dollar

63
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,169
or two and you can pimp them up yourself.
I decided to color the frame in green and

64
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,470
then decorate it with artificial flowers.
If you are giving it away for Christmas you

65
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,860
can switch the color to red and decorate it
with snowflakes for example. But I wanted

66
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,039
to make a frame that you can have on your
night stand all year around. I applied two

67
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,789
coats of paint to get it nice and opaque.
Wait for a few hours or until it is completely

68
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,560
dry and we are ready to glue on some flowers.
You can buy such fake flowers on the internet

69
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,740
for super cheap. I still have a lot left from
my hair accessories and school supplies tutorials,

70
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,389
remember? I put five flowers on two corners
of my frame, but you can stick them all around

71
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:29,560
the frame if you prefer. In any case the picture
frame will turn out gorgeous! Put in a picture

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,400
of you and whoever you are giving this frame
to – your friend, mom, grandma and I guarantee,

73
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,410
you will melt their heart. I mean... who wouldn't
be absolutely blown away by receiving such

74
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,509
a special and thoughtful gift. Every time
they will look at this beautiful picture,

75
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:48,229
they will remember how lucky they are to have
such a special person in their life – you.

76
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:52,870
Every chocolate lover would be thrilled to
receive these home made chocolate bonbons.

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,759
They are very quick and so much fun to make.
You need some silicone molds, chocolate and

78
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,380
toppings like sprinkles and mixed nuts. First
we need to melt the chocolate. I’m doing

79
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,069
that in the microwave so I have to break the
chocolate into the microwaveable cups. I have

80
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,690
some milk and some white chocolate. Yum, yum!
You can also melt your chocolate over the

81
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:23,550
stove. Once the chocolate is melted, pour
it into the mold – I have this heart shaped

82
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:29,259
one, but you can find so many other cool designs
in a store. Flatten the chocolate with a spoon

83
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,090
and then add toppings of your choice. I have
some shredded coconut, chopped hazelnuts and

84
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,590
sprinkles for the first three. I want to make
more than that so here comes another row of

85
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,210
chocolate yumminess. Here I am also using
some blue sugar and pines. Let’s now make

86
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:51,090
some white chocolate bonbons. Wait what?!
I figured that I overcooked mine, so white

87
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,789
chocolate rest in peace. But we're not going
to stress about it for too long because I

88
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,710
have some milk chocolate left. Leave them
to cool completely, you can also put them

89
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,300
into the fridge for a while. Time to take
these babies out of the molds! Look at this

90
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,750
perfection! OMG I'm so proud of myself right
now. Totally tapping myself on the shoulder,

91
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,870
no shame. They look so professionally made,
right? I'm gonna try this one. No girl these

92
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,830
are not for you, these are for the gift, they
look so good I just wanna eat them. Put them

93
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,300
in a jar or a pretty gift box. Decorate it
with some ribbon to make it more festive!

94
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,110
You can personalize it for a friend that you
are making them for. For example if that person

95
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,620
is all about healthy living use 70% chocolate
and top the bonbons with healthy stuff like

96
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,880
nuts and goji berries. These are such a yummy
and awesome gift.

97
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,830
Ear hats are a huge trend and you can actually
make them yourself! I'm going to show you

98
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:52,200
how. All you need is an inexpensive hat, two
buttons, thread and a needle plus some yarn.

99
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,910
First we need to make two pompoms. Wrap the
yarn around the palm of your hand about hundred

100
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,620
times. Trim the excess and take the yarn ball
of your hand. Take a short piece of yarn or

101
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:10,220
thread and wrap it around the yarn ball tightly.
You end up with this bow shape. With scissors

102
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:17,660
cut through the loops on both sides. The bow
shape is gone and we end up with a fluffy

103
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,459
yarn ball. Time to make our pompom nice and
rounded so just have fun with scissors and

104
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,019
play with it until you are satisfied with
how it looks. There we go – this one is

105
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:31,310
looking pretty posh! But since all the animals
have two ears, we have to make the second

106
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,420
pom pom, which has to be of the same size
as the first one. Our two balls of fluffiness

107
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,899
are ready and we can attach them to the hat.
Thread your needle and make a couple of stitches

108
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:45,830
for each of the ears. If you want you can
just use fabric glue. Since my pom poms are

109
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,560
quite big and heavy I figured that sewing
will probably work best for me. Make a final

110
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,510
knot inside the hat, snip away the excess
thread and the first ear is done. Do the same

111
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:06,480
for the other one. Just by adding ears, this
hat looks so much prettier than before, right?!

112
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,579
You can totally finish here or you can give
our bear a face like me. For the eyes I am

113
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:16,649
using a couple of white buttons to match the
ears. Sew them on a hat using black thread,

114
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,480
which will represent the pupils. Besides being
an awesome gift idea, this project is also

115
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,810
great for up-cycling your old hats and refreshing
your winter wardrobe. I will definitely make

116
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,990
another one for myself if I give this hat
away because I just love it so much. For the

117
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,820
nose and mouth I am using yarn and fabric
glue. Make a little oval shape for bear's

118
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:46,310
nose and a wave for the mouth. Here we have
it, our mister bear hat all done and looking

119
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:52,010
epic. This DIY is really inexpensive, but
so unique and special. The lucky person who

120
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,029
receives a gift like that will surely feel
special and appreciated.

121
00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,430
You know what guys I was thinking that none
of my friends have birthdays in the next days

122
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,279
and I am feeling pretty hungry so I am just
going to dig into the ice cream box. I have

123
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,350
to give it a little quality control to make
sure it's good enough as a gift, right? I

124
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:18,769
am taking two scoops of raspberry sorbet which
is so good! A little whipped cream never hurt

125
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:25,779
nobody, so let’s put it on top. Time for
the toppings! I’m going for some honey first,

126
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,640
because raspberry sorbet can be quite sour
and we need to balance it out with sweet honey.

127
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,089
We also have to check out how the sprinkle
scoop works! Mmm nice, I'm going to mark it

128
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:40,790
as approved. All we need now is some décor
and an ice cream spoon. How pretty is this

129
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,529
snowflake! You can make decorations like these
yourself. Cut some shapes of your choice from

130
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:50,430
colored paper and stick them on a toothpick.
After a quality control has been performed,

131
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:57,350
I can totally approve this ice cream box as
a perfect gift for any occasion! I Love it!

132
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,690
Happy Birthday!

133
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,180
If you need some small and inexpensive presents
to give to your friends – these candy bonbons

134
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,000
are perfect. To make them you'll need some
candy, ribbon, cellophane, tape, toilet paper

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,579
roll, wrapping paper and scissors. Start by
wrapping the craft paper around the roll and

136
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,380
secure it with a piece of tape. Fold the extra
paper on the sides inside the roll like this.

137
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:30,250
Pop the candy of your choice into the opening.
Take your cellophane and wrap it around the

138
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:37,579
candy roll. Secure it in place with tape.
Make two ribbon bows on the sides and you

139
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:49,130
get a perfect bonbon shape. How cute are these!?
Make a bunch of different colors and give

140
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,240
them to your best friends or you can use them
as stocking fillers. Easy, inexpensive and

141
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,870
totally adorable little gifts, I am in love!

142
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,660
Anyone that loves beauty and likes to pamper
herself would be happy to receive this moisturizing

143
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:11,240
body scrub. You need a bowl, a jar, essential
oil, food coloring, sugar and coconut oil.

144
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,350
Pour quarter of a cup of melted coconut oil
into the bowl and add a cup of sugar. Add

145
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,060
a few drops of essential oil, I am using peppermint
and mix in a bit of blue food coloring. Mix

146
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,620
the ingredients together really well. If you
need to you can still add sugar or oil at

147
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:35,490
this point to get the perfect consistency.
Pour the scrub into a jar. To make the gift

148
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:44,089
prettier you can decorate it with stickers
– write on a name and stick it on the lid.

149
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,660
I also decided to wrap a piece of white raffia
around and make a bow. What a gorgeous little

150
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,130
present right?! Especially in the winter when
our skin gets dry it is really important to

151
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:58,060
exfoliate and moisturize. This scrub works
perfectly because it does both – removes

152
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,959
dry skin and death cells plus moisturizes.

153
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,510
Now let's make some marble bowls which are
a great decorating and organizing piece for

154
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:13,529
any age. We're gonna need some clay, a bowl,
dough roller and a gold fabric marker. Roll

155
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:26,389
the colors of your choice into strips like
this. I have white, green, violet and yellow.

156
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,620
Now you need to twist all the strips together
and the more you twist, the more marbley your

157
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,410
bowls are going to be. I want my design to
be quite full so I decided to roll my clay

158
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:42,230
again and then twist it like that. Just play
with it so that the clay colors mix together.

159
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,500
When you feel like you have a good pattern,
form the clay into a little marble ball. Place

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,600
it on the flat surface and use a roller or
something rounded like a vase or a bottle

161
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:58,680
to flatten it. Just as you would be baking
cookies. Place the clay on top of the bowl

162
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,850
and let it dry. Here I made another one. For
this one I swirled the clay even more so I

163
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,870
got an even more marbley rustic look. I decided
to put it inside the bowl and make the edge

164
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:15,570
even more wavy, by folding it in. My clay
is air drying so I just have to wait for a

165
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,649
few hours for my bowls to dry and harden,
but you can bake them and speed up the process.

166
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:25,430
For the finishing touch color the edge in
gold or any other color. You can use a marker

167
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,440
or acrylic paint to do that. Ta-da the marble
dishes are all ready and a perfect gift for

168
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,639
a friend, your mom, grandma or anyone that
likes cute room decorating pieces. These are

169
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,079
great for storing jewelry, or anything else
like keys, pins, you name it.

170
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,870
What is better than drinking a morning coffee
or tea from a mug made by someone very special

171
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,699
to you? DIY mugs are a cute and super easy
idea perfect for all ages. To make them you

172
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:58,100
need a white mug and some porcelain markers.
This one would be perfect for a birthday gift.

173
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,100
I started with a party garland and some balloons.
First I like to outline the picture in black

174
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,040
and then I'll add some color. Plain mugs are
very inexpensive and the markers will last

175
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,620
you forever, so you'll be able to make a lot
of gifts using them. All you have to do is

176
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,480
transform yourself into a creative mug designer
and make some awesome drawings on the mugs.

177
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,509
I am really not that good in drawing, so don't
judge me. But that is the point of DIY-ing!

178
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:29,589
You don't have to be a Picasso to make a gift
like that. I also decided to add a little

179
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,029
quote – ""smile it looks good on you"". Not
just smile, the person I'm gonna give this

180
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:38,579
mug to will probably laugh every morning when
drinking coffee, thinking about how terrible

181
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:43,949
drawer I am. Feel free to leave your mug in
black and white but you know me – I love

182
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:59,670
color so I had to spice it up a bit. Looking
awesome! Now on to the other mug! I wanted

183
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,319
this one to be more winter related so I'm
writing on ""baby it's cold outside"". I don't

184
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,910
know about you guys but boy it's been getting
pretty cold here in Norway lately, so this

185
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,049
totally feels appropriate. On the bottom part
of the mug I am drawing 3 penguins – poor

186
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,959
babies freezing in the snow. Start with an
oval for the body, horizontal number three

187
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,059
for the face and two lines for the white belly.
Using yellow marker make a beak and their

188
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:32,789
feet. And since I am making fantasy penguins
I am coloring them in green, pink and blue.

189
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:39,880
This DIY doesn't take more than five minutes
and you get such a nice gift! Just perfect!

190
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,809
To make your mugs dish washer proof we have
to pop them in the oven for the marker to

191
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,700
harden. Follow the instructions for your markers
as they can be a bit different. I have to

192
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,080
bake my mugs at three hundred Fahrenheit for
ninety minutes. Voila, here they are all finished

193
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,070
and looking awesome. I love how you can be
so creative with these mugs. You can make

194
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:08,460
so many awesome designs. Drawings, patterns,
quotes... sky is the limit. Quality control

195
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,730
is needed again so let's make some hot chocolate.
Little bit of milk, a teaspoon of cocoa powder

196
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,350
and whipped cream to make it extra delicious
and festive. Every time your friend will drink

197
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,240
from the mug that you made, he or she will
be reminded how special he or she is to you.

198
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,230
And that is a priceless feeling.

199
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:31,820
Last but definitely not least I'll show you
how to make these epic gloves or hand warmers,

200
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,039
which is probably my favorite gift idea in
a bunch. And no worries if you don't know

201
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,280
how to knit because I have no clue either,
tweenzies! You will need some yarn, ice cream

202
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,789
cup, glue gun, bobby pins, knitting hook and
a needle. Before we start knitting we need

203
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:51,650
to make a simple knitting loom. Start placing
pairs of pins around the edge of the cup like

204
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,220
that, leaving about half an inch between each
pair. If you don't have an ice cream cup you

205
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,360
can use a bigger coffee cup or any other hollow
rounded object. Time to take our glue gun

206
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,549
and let's apply some glue over and around
each pin to make sure they will stay in place

207
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:16,299
while knitting. When all the pins are glued
in place we can proceed to the fun part – knitting!

208
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,140
Take your yarn and this is optional – a
straw. Thread the yarn through it. Straw makes

209
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,100
it easier to wrap the yarn around each pin.
Leave about five inches of yarn hang loose

210
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,330
and then start wrapping the yarn around each
pin. Make sure that you have loops on the

211
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:36,410
outside and the connecting line of yarn on
the inside of the loom. When you reach the

212
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,030
first pin, just continue with one more row
above the first one. See how quickly you can

213
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,210
wrap the yarn around the pins using a straw?!
The second wrapping row is finished so it's

214
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,919
time to take the hook and pull the bottom
loops over the top ones. Grab the bottom loop

215
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,330
– the one closer to the cup edge – pull
it over the top loop and over the pin like

216
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,020
that. If you don't have a hook you can easily
make one from a piece of wire or you can pull

217
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,740
with fingers too. Go all around the loom until
our first row is finished. Time to again wrap

218
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,080
the around the pins – but from now
on we only need to wrap them once, because

219
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,960
as you can see, we already have our first
row of yarn from before. When all the pins

220
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,380
are wrapped take a hook and pull the bottom
loops over the top ones. These are the two

221
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,130
steps that you need to keep repeating until
your glove is long enough: wrap the yarn around

222
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,460
the pins, pull the bottom loops over the top
ones. Then again wrap the yarn around the

223
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,980
pins and again pull the bottom loops over
the top ones, it's that simple! You can make

224
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,539
the gloves using only one color of yarn, or
you can make stripes of different colors.

225
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:44,340
I decided to make a green edge on these gloves
so I need to switch the yarn. This is very

226
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:50,140
easy. Snip the pink working yarn, leaving
about five inches extra like that. Take the

227
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,510
green yarn and thread on a straw. Now simply
make a knot tying together the pink and green

228
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,140
yarn like that. Then continue the same two
easy steps as before. This time using green

229
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,840
yarn. Wrap the yarn around each pin and then
pull the bottom loops over the top ones. And

230
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,600
that's the whole story, it's really easy,
you really have to try. I love this quick

231
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,770
loom knitting technique because it is so simple
and it only takes about two hours to make

232
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,150
a beautiful glove! Especially this time of
the year, when it gets dark so quickly I love

233
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:24,190
cosying up on the couch wrapped in blankets,
watch some TV and knit these gloves. I find

234
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,940
it really relaxing and therapeutic. Call me
granny, it's like ""granny's beauty corner"".

235
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,400
After twenty two pink and five green rows
I believe this glove is long enough so I am

236
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,309
going to pull the bottom loops over the top
ones for the last time and then we'll make

237
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:45,179
a finishing crochet row. To make it you can
use a crochet hook like me, but the knitting

238
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,919
hook from before or a piece of wire would
work just fine too. Pull the first loop from

239
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,200
the pin and onto the hook. Take your working
yarn and wrap it around the hook like this.

240
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,730
Now you need to pull the first loop over the
second one and off the hook. Add the loop

241
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,280
from the second pin onto the hook and again
wrap the working yarn around the hook. As

242
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,200
you can see you have three loops on the hook.
Pull the middle one over the third loop and

243
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,070
then the first one over the third loop. Continue
this step until you take all the loops off

244
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,679
the pins. I feel like I'm saying ""hook"" hundred
billions times now, but I really want you

245
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,450
guys to understand. Let's repeat: take the
loop of the pin, wrap the working yarn around

246
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,340
the hook and you're left with 3 loops on the
hook. Pull over the middle one and the first

247
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,169
one. Then repeat the step. When you reach
your last pin, the glove will come off the

248
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:47,039
loom. You are left with a little loop and
the working yarn which we have to trim leaving

249
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,780
about five inches of extra. Lead the yarn
through the loop and make a couple of knots

250
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,710
and stitches to make sure that the glove won't
fall apart. We want it to last many years.

251
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:04,720
I am using a big knitting needle but you can
totally make one using a piece of wire. On

252
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,250
the opposite end of the glove you still have
this first yarn end peaking out. Make a few

253
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:17,809
knots and stitches to secure your work. I
decided to make an extra knot where we switched

254
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:22,980
the colors just to be sure. Now we can snip
away all that extra yarn hanging out. Push

255
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,970
the knot from the yarn switch inside the glove
to hide it and we are all done, and ready

256
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,900
to admire these adorable hand knitted gloves.
You can make them for yourself or you can

257
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,289
give them as the most beautiful and thoughtful
gift ever. Switch up the colors and you can

258
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,460
make these gloves for anyone – girlfriend,
boyfriend, grandpa and I guarantee they will

259
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
be overwhelmed.

260
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,940
Home made gifts are much more thoughtful,
unique and special then the store bought ones.

261
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,690
Take some time this year and make gifts for
your friends and family and show them how

262
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,250
much they mean to you! You will melt their
heart, because with home made gifts you don't

263
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,289
give an object – you give love.

264
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,429
These were my ten DIY gifts ideas perfect
for Christmas, birthdays or any kind of day

265
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:06,610
when you want to tell your friends and family
that you love them. Let me know in the comments,

266
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,590
which of the ten ideas was your favorite and
also give the video some love if you want

267
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,830
more Christmas related videos, maybe a room
decor or something like that. Let me know...

268
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,570
That is it for today, thank you so much for
watching and I'll talk to you really soon.

269
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,279
Oh and before I go, don't forget to check
out the Christmas videos, I did last year.

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,750
good morning

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,810
arguing afternoons after August

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,700
summertime so we decided to sleep in and

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:39,000
it's raining outside

6
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:41,370
it's about 11:35 so the first thing we

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
both do is reach for our phones to check

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:58,829
our social media see what we've missed

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:01:00,780
into 12 hours we've been sleeping after

10
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,080
checking Instagram we move on to our

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,150

so best being is a game puzzler that has

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,590
many levels and you basically assemble

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:20,030
an army of characters called fiends

17
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,350

so now it's time to put some clothes on

22
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,310
so we can actually walk around the house

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,280
[Music]

24
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,330
next thing we do is make our favorite

25
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:02,390
meal of the day breakfast

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,550
[Music]

27
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,040
the night before we always cut our

28
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,700
watermelon and pre make our avocado

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,700
mixture

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,120
pretty much we eat

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,790
Ezequiel toast with an avocado mixture

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:36,100
daily just give you guys a heads up it's

33
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:38,590
way better toasted because watermelon is

34
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,750
in season we have been going through

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:50,800
three watermelons a day because we are

36
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:53,290
obsessed with juicing them literally one

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,590
watermelon can make six full glasses of

38
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:04,449
juice

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,449

43
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,250
so basically since the house is always

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,170
empty in the morning my sister and I

45
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,200
like to gossip and catch up on some

46
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,200
things

[Music]

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,910

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,130
Gloria that made us this optic auto make

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,450

Payne's turn today

55
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,020
normally after breakfast we would have

56
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,940
gone out to our pool with our friends

57
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,490

58
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,020

60
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:59,590
practice a typical summer day we keep it

61
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,750
real simple

62
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,700
first we splash water on our face and

63
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,620
then add a little cleanser then

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,230
obviously rinse it off and then put some

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,230
SPF lotion on and then brush our teeth

66
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:22,529

67

[Music]

70
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,670
so some mascara and a little bit of lip

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,670
gloss and that's it

72
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,300
i MV pan because she always is so

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:52,190
organized and she always has her clothes

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:54,680
laid out the night before the Vegas he

75
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:59,210
sucks out any moisture on your skin so

76
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,949
you always got to wear lotion just

77
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,700
because Payton slept with me last night

78
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:17,829

198,Making Some Changes! | Thomas Sanders,K6ZnRPMDjg8,"Changes in our lives can be scary and disorienting at times, and I've been going through my fair share of them. I find my self longing for the simpler times with familiar faces, so the different aspects of my personality step in to convince me I shouldn't be afraid of change... or stick to what is familiar. Hope you enjoy it!!

know that I was just making sure that it

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,930
was known I was the sign that did the

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,629

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,530
that but I was thinking the only thing

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,220
better than being cool was being back in

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,229

36
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,110

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,060
does this place look so familiar

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,439

39
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,150

you what with sudden change the heart

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,130
tends to be in confused and well I'm

42
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,170
always confusing that the truth maybe I

43
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,970
should clarify more confused then on

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,670
average that sounds about right

45
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,420

46
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,540
anything

47
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,689

00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,299
Vilanch

51
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,100
but why is it because of that whole

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,380
growing up thing do we need to revisit

53
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,630
that no it's not that I mean maybe that

54
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,189

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,020
that have come so rapidly lately I'm

56
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,659

57
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,009
traveling a lot more even my wardrobe

58
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,100

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,319
sounds flippin sweet ma'am it is

60
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,870
clip-in sweet man I guess I'm just

61
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,150
getting all reminiscent over what once

62
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,800
was and chiz well Thomas

63
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,810
everyone gets homesick from time to time

64
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,069
do you Logan Patton we are all fractions

65
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,680
of Thomas's personality that is

66
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,480
impossible with you I'm always home you

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,300
need to chill out I do need to chill out

68
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,980
yes yes Athens that's my name don't wear

69
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,940
it out impossible seeing as how I just

70
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,440
learned about it in the last vlog

71
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,239
through I don't know why these changes

72
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,100
are causing this sudden surge of

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,959
emotions but we can deal with them and

74
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,959
we can keep moving forward you with me

75
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:42,019
yeah additional affirmation wait aah

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,670
this was so close what up anxiety just

77
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,170
here to say I'm on your side

78
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,970
who is side by side what am i arguing

79
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,950
quiet just let me do the talking anxiety

80
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,959
this isn't an argument we're all on the

81
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,500
same side here really I find that hard

82
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,209
to believe

83
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,250
you wonder why all these changes are

84
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,530
throwing you off it's the lessening of

85
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,209
steady constants in your life oh my

86
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,799
goodness that's right Thomas and you are

87
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,989
a Taurus when you're in these new

88
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,209
settings and situations you know

89
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,100
something is off what is something you

90
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,709
can't even give an example something is

91
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,030
off I hate it when you're just big

92
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,320
anxiety what do we do know you were

93
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,970
listening to me before remember how

94
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,280
smart I was we have a bubble the bubble

95
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,890
is nice here and anything you need to do

96
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,170
you can get done in your familiar bubble

97
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,760
which is not how dream chasing works oh

98

I do not like you I don't get it last

99
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,570
time you were on my case about weather

100
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,430
here was where I needed to be yes but

101
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,209
lately are you just trying to counter

102
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,150
everything I do

103
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,810
no it's sing what you're friends you're

104
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,220
always away from your friends oh that's

105
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,370
why I've been feeling more confused than

106
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,780
Beveridge average no I'm not you care

107
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,459
about whether or not I'm around my

108
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,530
friends look let's not read into this

109
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,230
and make it any more angsty than it has

110
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,239
to be we all know that I'm a bit dismal

111
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,780
monochromatic I see whatever and you're

112
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,250
really good friends they help me out

113
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,570
they provide constancy oh okay fine you

114
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,120
and morality have a point

115
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,769
no no possible alliance sure nerds great

116
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,299
half wait Thomas yes friends are a

117
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:06,350
positive and I can appreciate having

118
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:07,730
them in your life even though they

119
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,440
encourage nonsensical and unsafe

120
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,030
behavior they also can help with your

121
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,250
overall mental health and well-being but

122
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,510
they're not going anywhere you don't

123
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,949
know that you said you shut up

124
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,760
they're not waiting on you to pursue

125
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:19,250
their dream

126
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,500
so you mustn't wait on them they could

127
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,030
be gone at any moment maybe all this

128
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,160
traveling is giving them the impression

129
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,670
you don't need them anymore

130
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,830
no that's not true we're losing them

131
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,250
come on or the greater one huh

132
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,960
what if his friends never leave

133
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,290
unrealistic what if some of his friends

134
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,470
take his side why did I think it was a

135
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:45,110
good idea to join forces with you you

136
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,820
guys can shape-shift there we go ah yes

137
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,890
being mental projections of your own

138
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,720
personality it kind of makes sense don't

139
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,520

140
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,480

Roman calm down we're all still the same

163
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,850
aspects of Thomas's personality so he

164
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,340
can pronounce all around alright then

165
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,350
you get a stop in anxiety no I am NOT

exercise if all aspects took part I'm

170
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,850
comfortable just the way I am

171
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,660
and besides Thomas this isn't gonna do

172
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,480

179
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,569

180
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,509

do this before

184
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,289
can you stop breaking the fourth wall

185
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,539
it's not quite a fourth wall it's really

186
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:43,500
more of a single column in the middle of

187
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:45,030

close the book on your back-to-back

195
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,690
dilemmas I don't know other series would

196
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,550
continue if we stopped having dilemma

197
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,220
easy Meta Knight we're recording the

198
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,360

call them out for it but then

200
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,469
immediately took it more meta let's get

201
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,969
back on track yeah I think this could

202
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:17,759
work might take a little getting used to

203
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:20,520
but you both deserve a patent of that

204
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,530
for this one did you just make a self

205
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,120
referential puns oh yeah I've been

206
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,909
waiting to do it ever since I revealed

207
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,330
my name up until that point I was patent

208
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,159
pending

00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,169
I'm out you'll see me or anyone else

210
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,449

213
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,400
chance because you volumes too low don't

you dare get you're dead to me

215
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:49,880
this is incredibly amusing but but yes

216
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,259
but but something is just not right

217
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,909
about this perhaps we're not in the

218
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,229
right alignment what do you mean that

219
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,490
means maybe this combination of friends

220
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,710
isn't quite a knit not the correct usage

221
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,610
of almost you gotta be joking you know

222
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,229
I'm not allow me to demonstrate

223
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,370

224
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:13,110
fit hmm stop doing this okay I just love

225
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,819

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,330
February cards okay guys I don't think

234
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,250
you switching around is helping of

235
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,550
course it's not Thomas because that's

236
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,440
not what you meet do I act like Joan no

237
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,780

alright see it doesn't feel right

243
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:57,160
because we are not actually your friends

244
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,930
but we will just like them would it help

245
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,030
if we attempted to behave like them

246
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:02,170

want me to just stay at home but change

256
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,410
is inevitable and I know change is a

257
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,720
part of life and my friends have their

258
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:28,020
own lives but they've always been there

259
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:32,830

264
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,470

we agreed to work as a team on this one

269
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,260

270
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,600

280
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,060

284
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,650
mooglies I don't know who I am anymore

285
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,930
I don't have to look like anyone to make

286
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,880
sense he's right we are part of a whole

287
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,350
visualize aspects of your single

288
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,870
personality your real friends are

289
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,280
complicated multifaceted individuals

290
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,620
none of them would fit neatly into any

291
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,470
one of us nothing beats the real thing I

292
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,690
just said that she am I at all like

293
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,540
parents no you're not I'm getting real

294
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,310
sick

295
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,230
this you know you are anxiety this

296
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,120
constant change is exactly what I was

297
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,339
trying to avoid in the first place I

298
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,170
guess some changes unavoidable you just

299
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,110
need to keep the change

300
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:57,079
oh oh I just winter those pennies hope

301
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,630
the coppers don't come after me why did

302
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:02,779
you switch with me it was last combo you

303
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,519
gotta happen I'm proud impeccable

304
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,350
okay patent in the form of Joan is not

305
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,329
happening guys okay now you just like

306
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,680
being Joan Paulson Thomas there is

307
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:11,509
administrable change and an

308
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,149
administrable change that's not a real

309
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:15,620
word on administration never change you

310
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,269
can control and change you cannot

311
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,399
control them following and then there's

312
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:22,519
change you can control but shouldn't

313
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,680
like changing me through are you kidding

314
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,839
me all right just Valerie first so the

315
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,940
change that I can't control is the fact

316
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,100
that me and my friends are all moving in

317
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,170
different directions we have our own

318
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,259
goals are on dreams that's something

319
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:39,920
that can't and shouldn't be changed but

320
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:41,899
what we can control is our communication

321
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,910
with each other we can keep ourselves

322
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,350
updated vid chat enjoy each other's

323
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,269
company even if we're not in the same

324
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,610
place I mean some friendships even start

325
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:51,889
online or by mail and if years before

326
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,300
they meet if they ever do the spirit of

327
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,949
the friendship doesn't fade with

328
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,230
location or any other form of change

329
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:58,639
it's up to us and if you're truly not

330
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,589
happy with the change that's happening

331
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,449
in your life you can exercise what

332
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,850
agency you have over it as well you're

333
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,620
right most changes aren't too far out of

334
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,660
my control

335
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,010
that calms me down great will can use a

336
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,500
little bit of that control to change me

337
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,040

video to start win so this game plays a

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,619
little bit like Nicko at Zuma if you

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,230

fuck's sake there's so much weird shit

71
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,550
in this game you can be a fucking barrel

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
you can be whatever you want in this

73
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:46,680
game maybe so here's where you can buy

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,780
items for view so you collect and pimp

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,750
out your room oh boy that's a good

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,670
window oh oh got that click on the Eagle

77
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,950
that's five subscribers thank you

78
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,170
sponsor eagle you can choose to play the

79
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,060
game passively like I mentioned but we

80
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,040
also made it so if you want to keep

81
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,720
playing you have that option so you can

82
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,190
play puggle this is actually the first

83
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,700
time I see the finished version of this

84
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,470
it looks awesome

85
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,000
oh my god it's Edgar hey I got the food

86
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,890
ball hell yeah

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,980
there's a skill tree in the game which

88
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,380
lets you traged eyes strategize how you

89
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,239
want to get more views faster there's

90
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,890
different methods I like to go for

91
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,080
streaming because that way you can gain

92
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,020
views while you're not playing the game

93
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,260
which is pretty cool we call acknowledge

94
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,450
there is a fuck load of items in this

95
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,040
game cuz this game is supposed to last

96
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,900
you a long time this game is going to be

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,090
your best friend for the next six months

98
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,370
I'm not kidding so if you don't want to

99
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,780
spend any money in the game you 100%

100
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,340
don't have to that's the thing that

101
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,049
everyone keeps complaining about when we

102
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,989
we made legend in the brofist be like

103
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:53,390
yeah it's a cool game I guess but it's

104
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,360
not fucking free is it well here you go

105
00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,100
it's free now you could boost while

106
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,380
watching ads don't play those games

107
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,819
though just play my game does it seem

108
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,860
sketchy that I'm sitting over the hoodie

109
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,959
introducing this thing yeah you guys you

110
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,150
guys are gonna get real hype to this so

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,920
the goal of the game is obviously to get

112
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,480
the most subscribers but the way you get

113
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,060
that is to get more items and

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,940
customizing yourself and that's a huge

115
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,650
part of the game which is the social

116
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,289
aspect of it I'll tell you what that

117
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,090
means basically you'll be able to vote

118
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,090
on other people's rooms if you really

119
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,919
like how someone how they customize that

120
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,169
you can vote for them or you can follow

121
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,660
them it's basically like getting YouTube

122
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,090
subscribers so be a ranking of all all

123
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,700
of this so it's a very competitive

124
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:45,770
aspect of the game okay I literally made

125
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,720
this in just like a few minutes so I

126
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,820
could pimp it out a lot more but the

127
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,890
idea is basically that no matter what

128
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,650
kind of youtuber you would like to make

129
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,900
or which youtuber you want to make say

130
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,530
here you want to make a youtuber focus

131
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,229
on music or beauty or gaming or funny

132
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,169
videos or creepy videos you can make

133
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,450
that youtuber in this game and customize

134
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,450
your setup accordingly and I think

135
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,420
that's really cool I'm so again I am so

136
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,940
excited for you Bros to play this

137
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,740
all right you can definitely get weird

138
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,740
with this game let's just say that it's

139
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,050
gotta keep making videos and one day

140
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,430
you'll be able to beat poopie pie like I

141
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,380
said it's very creative so I'm really

142
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,230
excited to see how you bros are gonna

[LYRICS]

Don’t deal with the devil
A lesson that I learned well
When I meddled
Made a bet and now it’s settled
Say farewell to Elder Kettle

I’m on an adventure
Indentured
Fetching debts from sketchy characters

I’m a kitchen dish
that can dish it out
Quick, tip me over
and pour me out
I’m short and stout
and I’m rockin’ out
and I’m knockin’ out
with my pinkie out

And I’m counting down
But don’t count me out
When you pick me up
You won’t put me down
Now the whole toon towns on lockdown
And the list goes like this... (oh!)

Grim Matchstick
Dr. Kahls Robot
Sally Stageplay
Baroness Von Bon Bon
Hilda Berg
Rumor Honeybottoms
Cagney Carnation
And the Root Pack!
Goopy Le Grande
Djimmi the Great
Beppi the Clown
Ribby and Croaks
Phantom Express
Cala Maria
Three Mausoleums
Wally Warbles
Werner Werman
Captain Brineybeard
You signed a contract!

My name is Cuphead
Fragile, empty-headed, artful-dodger
Tricked by easy riches
Now I’m picking fights with monsters
Twenty times my size
(Oh snap!)

I’m sorry that I bet it all
I’m sorry that I have to hurt you
We both signed the dotted line
Now it’s your soul or mine!
(At midnight the clock will chime)

Face to face
With every loss I take
I learn the way the bosses change
And hey
They say that two can play at this game!
Uh-huh
Multiplayer aeroplanes
Oh brother, where art thou?
(Mugman!)

I’m sorry that we lost our souls
I’m sorry that I roped you into this
We co-signed the dotted line
Now It’s your soul and mine
(sing the chorus one more time)

My name is Mugman
Fragile, empty headed, Cuphead’s brother
Tricked by easy riches
Now I’m picking fights with monsters
Twenty times my size
(Oh snap!)

I’m sorry that we bet it all
I’m sorry that we have to hurt you
We all signed the dotted line
Now it’s your soul or mine
We signed a contract!

Snake Eyes
King Dice
Deck is stacked, dice are loaded
Yet I still survive

Don’t deal with the devil
A lesson that I learned well
Still indebted
So I rebelled
We descended
Made him cry and now it’s settled
Say goodbye to that darn devil
Swear the story’s not embellished
I’m a dish a bit disheveled
Relishing the bellows
From my fellow fiends of Inkwell
That I let go
“Hip-hip-Hoorah” echos
Turn the page and say
All’s well that ends well!","1

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,260
So I rebelled

128
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,800
We descended

129
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
Made him cry and now it's settled,

130
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,680
Say goodbye to the darn devil

131
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,220
And the story's not embellished

132
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm a dish a bit disheveled

133
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,760
Relishing the bellows

134
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,380
From my fellow

135
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,920
Fiends of Inkwell

136
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,560
That I let go

137
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,060
""Hip-hip Hoorah"" echos

138
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,640
Turn the page and say

139
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,500
All's well that ends well!

Thank you!","1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,720
Do you understand me?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
Nobody does...

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,720
It's been years

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,240
Since I've seen a face 'round here

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,160
I was broken and alone

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,720
In that hell I called my home

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,560
You always choose to stay

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,200
Spend your nights keeping me away

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,880
You think you stand a chance to last

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,640
Against the ghosts of your past..?

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,320
It's been years

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,720
I was broken and alone

14

In that hell I called my home

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Should've left me to decay

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,800
Finding me was your worst mistake

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,720
And I've found my new obsession...

18
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,680
Now it's just you and me

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,200
You turn away, I'll be right beside you

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,060
You cut me off, but I'll always have another way

21
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,480
To find you

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,260
My body's still mending, you're in for a sight

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,720
Another night, but it doesn't get easy

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,560
Because you're stuck, picking up all the pieces

25
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,180
That they salvaged

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,780
No matter what the ending, you won't last the night

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,580
And I hear you breathing in your room

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,760
Now, don't you panic, it'll all be over soon

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,220
And you can play your little games all day...

30
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,680
You'll never be free!

31
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,000
You block me out all you want

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,800
But I hear the sounds

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,260
The echo of a ""hello""

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320

maybe he will do that and then we'll

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,079
have some problems but until he does

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,989
that yeah I don't care about politics

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,730
did but he said some stupid shit do I

22
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,500
think he's got to go through with any of

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,290
it do I think he's gonna deport every

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,150
fuckin illegal no I don't and even if he

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,970
fucking wanted to I don't think it

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,600
happens but who knows maybe maybe I am

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:17,280
under estimating the power of the god

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,259
Emperor Gallifrey is that like Trump's

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,970
just gonna show up with all right here

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,430

that going fuckin do it

36
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,979
my understanding of politics is pretty

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,310
fucking non-existent thug because I

38
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,860
haven't cared about that shit I'm like

39
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,170
forever so who knows maybe he can just

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,310
like give everyone instructions and be

41
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,710
like all right through the great

42
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,729
cleansing for me I'm just gonna sit back

43
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,729
and relax now

44
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:04,460

46
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,930

with hook so fucking bad man

56
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,160
so that's some clean movement that made

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,440
it I like that I like that set of auto

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,780
attacks that I've lit out okay I like

I can't just insta kill him that's kind

73
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,400
of sad for a minute

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,780

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,070
yeah can I get the devil did the juicy I

76
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,470
just don't know how much damage ID allah

77
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,840
tala t is so dumb because it's just like

78
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,030
i don't know how much damage i do

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,650
it's just like a meaningless number to

80
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,610
man because I don't know the value

81
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,610
behind this

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,060
you

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,260
I dropped my axe really Oh fuckin

84
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,270
business I didn't have to flash for that

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:02,910
I could have just used my mercurial but

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,120
it looked cool if I flash for it you

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,120
know

88
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,270
man my damage really is a lot lower than

89
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,270
it used to be though

90
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:30,030
haha life still just fucking damage yeah

91
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,639
my damage is a lot lower than it used to

92
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,350
be like I remember like if I was on this

93
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,570
fucking caitlyn before it like I'm

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,110
fucking to shove this guy now it takes

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,110
three

96
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,550
like I know I should be killing these

97
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,520
guy that was a fucking crit Otto on the

98
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,110
rise with no fucking arm right

99
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,110
pretty sure I should have one shot on

100
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,689
yeah three hits I mean the difference

101
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,909
between two hitting and three eating

102
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,159
someone could be pretty big lake and the

103
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,810
lake game is the same value so the

104
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,520
difference between two hitting and three

105
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,159
hitting someone like made games pretty

106
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,199
big I just don't like to lift ality

107
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:31,090
change because I give me the fucking

108
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,979
value that it does like why are you

109
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,319
giving me this stupid like why are you

110
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,930
giving me this meaningless numberless

111
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:39,550
validate like lafalot e itself doesn't

112
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,129
mean anything it's just like it's

113
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,419
basically a fucking math equation yeah I

114
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:45,370
don't know I don't know what they're

115
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,039
expecting like if people will just do

116
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:51,279
the nut okay so I have 34 with Baddeley

117
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,430
lethality this guy's level seven let me

118
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,639
just calculate this real quick okay so I

119
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:00,069
need I'm doing this much damage to them

120
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:02,169
like if I highlight a champion it should

121
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,240
give me like you know in Dragon Ball Z

122
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,279
where they have this scanner and it

123
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,870
tells you if they're like power level it

124
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,539
should tell me how much fucking armor

125
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:17,229
can I do to this champion hit right

126
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:21,839
which oh oh come on a trike man what

127
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,839
does he care just isn't finished yet

128
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:32,139
whoa oh that's a lot of people invading

129
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,419
so I don't know what changed about my

130
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,870
ability think something changed about my

131
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,870
debía

132
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:51,790
oh that's pretty good my W now wow that

133
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,400
sounded so sarcastic but that is not bad

134
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,350
I actually really like that twitch is

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,290
probably pretty good with like a hard CC

136
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,480
support something like a Leona you just

137
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,510
make it into a kill lane yeah this thing

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,970
being a persistence load too so it stays

139
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,790
on the field just really fuckin good

140
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,470
I'm thinking maybe maxing my W second

141
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,020
might be really good because now that

142
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,420
it's a persistence slow that adds a lot

143
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:19,240
more to it like that makes it a lot more

144
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,340
valuable thing I can see twitch being

145
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,000
played an LCS he's definitely not that

146
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:28,000
bad now I'm gonna try maxing my W yeah

147
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,620
he's in vis for a lot longer now like

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,360
you don't need the points in queue

149
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,039
anymore because at least I don't think

150
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,169
you need the points in queue because you

151
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,169
and fizz for a fucking eternity and now

152
00:08:49,150 --> 00:09:07,050
I think maybe my red will kill him he

153
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:07,050
got fucking healed them as I'm lucky no

154
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,369
[Applause]

155
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:33,750
[Applause]

156
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,750
Oh

157
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,810
oh my god I would have Penta killed them

158
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,329
fuck man

159
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:45,000
it which is so fucking good dude what

160
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:47,430
the hell dude who the fuck I think this

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,680
is a problem man this shit helps them

162
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,470
out so much hey that's why I always say

163
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,079
like people complain about riot but it's

164
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,230
like man who you gonna fuckin trust more

165
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:00,600
riot games that hire like fucking people

166
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,329
that no balance or fucking like bronze

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,160
flare like this definitely addresses

168
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,649
twitches pot like twitch has a problem

169
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,870
of pushing this W makes it so he can

170
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,660
push the way better it's cute

171
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,649
I feel like stilts quicker and it lasts

172
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,779
longer

173
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,699
it makes assassination attempts a lot

174
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,560
easier I'm gonna actually try this this

175
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:22,259
sounds fucking terrible but I'm gonna

176
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,730
give it a try I don't even think plants

177
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:25,860
are that bitly I don't see what the

178
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,800
problem is people have with plants like

179
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,470
I mean I feel like they're gimmicky but

180
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,449
it's nothing like oh my god plants are

181
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,129
gonna ruin the game it's like I don't

182
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,389
know why they're adding it them and

183
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,410
whatever it doesn't really change

184
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:39,959
anything

185
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,850
I do miss goes played I think ghostblade

186
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:45,620
was a lot better than this build but

187
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,620
whatever and don't fucking matter

188
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:08,120
god I love this item good this items

189
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,970
fucking legit yeah you have to spell

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,009
shield and stuff you can stealth I mean

191
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:15,079
it's probably a lot more balanced

192
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:17,180
because honestly if you could do the

193
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:19,790
edge of night if you could do the nice

194
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,069
bail while you're still there basically

195
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,990
be I don't want to say no counterplay

196
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,000
but it'd be really hard to deal with

197
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,130
twitch because this is an offensive item

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,370
so if you give me the ability to dodge

199
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,350
like a CC that someone needs when I open

200
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,670
up on them it just means you have to be

201

mama told you that drugs are bad but you

25
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,049

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,910
thought my best friend be gone in the

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,590
future but I was wrong should've stopped

30
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,300
you when I had the chance to do so but

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,860

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,009

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,259

37
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,490
saying it would lift your mood and make

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,229
you feel invincible

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,060
so you started skipping school hanging

40
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,710
which is what you do unaware that when

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,840

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,180

welcome back folks we are back today

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,519
with our good buddy Mack code to

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,199
continue our discussion on the topic of

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,420
game addiction or before calling it what

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,010
it really is game compulsion last week

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,630
we addressed the hype surrounding game

7
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,039
compulsion and talked about why we felt

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,690
so many young children spent their days

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,039
in front of a screen today we'll be

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,060
looking at the problem most often

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,100
associated with game addiction

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,720
adolescents and adults who withdraw from

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,250
real life in favor of a virtual world

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,530
I'm gonna tell you right now this

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,460
episode is gonna be a bit unusual we've

16
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,180
been trying to figure out how to handle

17
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,829
it for weeks

18
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,660
James has written and rewritten the

19
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,340
script probably a dozen times I think

20
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,079
I've seen maybe 15 different intro

21
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,280
paragraphs and 18 different closing

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,700
statements for this episode since we

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,559
started

24
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,760
I understand there's also a badly singed

25
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:50,500
book of notes sitting in his apartment

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,210
somewhere every time he's written it

27
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,530
it's just never coming out right but I

28
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,640
think we haven't figured out now you see

29
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,230
that whole time we were trying to

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,730
maintain objectivity on the issue and

31
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:59,620
cover the topic in our usual academic

32
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,879
clinical way but we've come to realize

33
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,890
that may not be the best way to go this

34
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,329
time for James in particular this topic

35
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,860
is a little too close to home and we

36
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,479
decided it's better to just be honest

37
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,209
biases and all so we're going to do

38
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:11,740
something very different today because

39
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,240
this topic has much more personal

40
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,439
significance for James I think it's

41
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,829
better if he'd be the one to talk about

42
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:22,209
it so yeah take it away man hey everyone

43
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,729
Dan's probably already told you this but

44
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:29,289
this is probably the hardest episode for

45
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:32,039
me to write and I I couldn't do it um so

46
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,039
this is what I got

47
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:40,170
it's my experience my experience with

48
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:45,280
game compulsion and where I'm at now I

49
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:48,250
had this revelation today because today

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,520
I talked to the first girl I ever loved

51
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,880
she'd come back after a decade last time

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,540
I saw her we were teenagers now she's a

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,480
doctor I lost a good memory I remember

54
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:04,210
kissing around the hood of my rx-7 for

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,990
fleeing the city myself for for eight

56
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:12,280
years but here we were reminiscing over

57
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:17,760
coffee about path seemed a beautiful

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:21,100
lifetime away um and we were adults I

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,920
watched her laugh with an ease she had

60
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,360
never had when we were young she'd grown

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,520
and I've grown and in that moment I

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,190
realized how much better life had become

63
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,280
how far from the awkward child I had

64
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,769
been when she first knew me that I'd

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,070
come I realized

66
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,650
so clearly how much better life gets

67
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:50,350
when you don't turn away from it which

68
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:52,630
is something that I once did when people

69
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:56,500
talk about game addiction they always

70
00:02:52,630 --> 00:03:00,400
ask why games are addictive rather than

71
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,070
what void they fill and right there's

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,350
what the conversation goes wrong when

73
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,540
you routinely choose games over things

74
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,580
you know to be important or you cease

75
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,489
participating in areas of life that you

76
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,050
used to find important to play games you

77
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,400
suffer from game addiction or game

78
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,430
compulsion

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,390
I tried that road my closest friend

80
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,850
sprinted down it but nobody heads that

81
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,910
way because their life is perfect no one

82
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:32,920
picks up a game and becomes an addict

83
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:35,799
when you well I guess that's the heart

84
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,239
of the issue games aren't addictive but

85
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,840
they offer something that is they offer

86
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,210
us a validation often people talk about

87
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,750
game addicts

88
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,060
as lazy or indolent or incapable or

89
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,050
stupid but nothing could be further from

90
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,480
the truth rather everyone I've ever run

91
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,210
into who has had to wrestle with this

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,710
particular demon at some point in their

93
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:03,150
life as a child full of promise and

94
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:08,310
their internalized the trap

95
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,950
I watched smart capable people submerge

96
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,610
their lives behind the safe unreality of

97
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,710
games when the world real world tells

98
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,380
them that all the things they can start

99
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,970
good about themselves aren't worthwhile

100
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,800
when with all their intellect their

101
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,410
ability to reason their willingness to

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,230
dogged ly produce to a goal they still

103
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,840
get dumped or lose their job or get

104
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,260
served notice for divorce that point

105
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,320
they turn to games because games agree

106
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,250
with them that those traits are

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,160
important that they reward them games

108
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,400
reward people for exactly those skills

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,370
and unfortunately here at least in the

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,460
u.s. high school and college the time

111
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,200
where the world shows us just how little

112
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,000
it can care about some of those things

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,090
that were most proud of some of the

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,240
things that we find best about ourselves

115
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:06,960
for me it was high school I had a lot of

116
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,150
things going for me at the time I found

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,330
my little misfit tribe in the theater

118
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,410
group later I had my guitar lots of

119
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,440
things outside of games I could

120
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,220
reinforce my sense of self yet I still

121
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,130
walked that road

122
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,320
it started with started with Ultima

123
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,080
Online I remember the first time I ever

124
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,870
taped down keys to make my character run

125
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,100
into a wall and play an instrument to

126
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,910
gain skill while I slept

127
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,560
I felt clever I went out of the world of

128
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,320
Britannia and it was more exciting than

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,890
my world I let me tinker let me explore

130
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:45,060
excited my curiosity in a way that my

131
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,400
classroom works just never did I played

132
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,890
muds on my dial-up so this seemed no

133
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,230
different but was the first time I

134
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,220
routinely lost sleep for a game it was

135
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,060
the first time I found my day is

136
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,850
possessed by thoughts of

137
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,080
electronic world during classes I

138
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,400
imagine new character builds when I

139
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,920
should have been doing homework I would

140
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,970
daydream about that nights run I told

141
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,460
myself it didn't matter

142
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,930
my grades slip but I was still passing

143
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,660
everything by a wide margin and I still

144
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:18,820
saw friends I considered it just good

145
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,820
fun um next it was Starcraft hi I found

146
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,530
this tiny room with a computer with

147
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:30,540
internet access at my school it had

148
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,530
unrestricted installed privileges and I

149
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,530
started spending most of my lunches

150
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,810
there even though I it's funny because

151
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:40,480
it was the room that the central heat

152
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,730
distribution pipes ran through and so it

153
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,710
had to have been at least 100 degrees in

154
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,440
that room most days um

155
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,330
but I played through without thinking of

156
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,300
the heat or the food IH should have been

157
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,220
eating what I might be missing out on

158
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:59,140
umm but in the end it was EverQuest I

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:03,790
was an erequest junkie that's my

160
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:06,640
confession my my closest friend skipped

161
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,930
school to pick us up two copies on along

162
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,360
on launch day he was a year older than

163
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,210
me we had met through theater and bonded

164
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,280
over games he was right there with me

165
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,730
over the wire when headhunting Etten's

166
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:25,320
in Britannia 3:00 a.m. he was on the

167
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,320
land when we do battlenet to be twos

168
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,310
there was this period for six months

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,610
where we didn't speak after he'd stolen

170
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,050
this girl I had a terrible crush on um

171
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:37,620
but I had been too shy at the time to

172
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,510
ask out he never figured it out though

173
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,100
that should have been my warning sign he

174
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,700
was so focused on games that he never

175
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,460
put together why I was hurt but in the

176
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,910
end we bonded again over games all was

177
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,960
forgiven after all who else would get my

178
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,740
inside jokes

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,040
mostly jokes about games for the next

180
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,690
few months we were fiends and pushers I

181
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,990
remember that on the few occasions we

182
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:09,460
one of the few occasions

183
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,530
there we actually left the house

184
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,880
voluntarily was if you'd if you're

185
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,690
familiar with Seattle we drive up to

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,430
Aurora get a cheap PC for another very

187
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,670
dear friend of mine it was an armed Mac

188
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,780
user yeah Mac sticker on this car but

189
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:29,720
this was his first PC no argument could

190
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,270
ever convince him to purchase one but

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,290
after we start telling him day after day

192
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:42,440
about the wonders of EverQuest EverQuest

193
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:44,840
eventually went out after that my grades

194
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,920
really started to crash I

195
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,230
I quit the play I was in um actually

196
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,480
angry that I had gotten a large role

197
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,240
because all I could think about was how

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,890
it would cut into my grinding I was

199
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,870
pretty much living off hot pockets and

200
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:04,940
bugles I would strategize about how to

201
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,800
steal hours of sleep during classes

202
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,270
constants that I knew I could get

203
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,460
through without looking at the text um I

204
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,630
just repeated to Nader I always put on

205
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,480
academic probation

206
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,430
um but I didn't care the first thing I

207
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,090
did was go play a request to try and

208
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,350
forget about it

209
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:26,240
I actually remember that night we were

210
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:30,800
we were waiting for one of our friends

211
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:34,250
to come from a distant zone and he got

212
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,270
on the boat to come to our zone and he

213
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,000
never arrived

214
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,550
he just kept zoning back and forth every

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,530
time we did the /who we would see him in

216
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,020
one of these bones because he'd fallen

217
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:49,580
asleep on the boat we just kept laughing

218
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,980
and laughing we thought it was

219
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:57,110
ridiculous we we didn't even realize how

220
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,000
absurd it was that we couldn't even stay

221
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,400
awake playing our own game anymore

222
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,400
that's how sort of strung out we were um

223
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,160
but

224
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,950
luckily things were to change from you

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,420
at that point um there was a night where

226
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,899
we were all supposed to go out to a

227
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:19,529
movie but me being too much of a fuckup

228
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,760
at that point I I missed it

229
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:26,430
perhaps unconsciously perhaps

230
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,870
intentionally I missed the film because

231
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,670
I didn't I I guess I didn't even want to

232
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,990
see our friends um and for some reason

233
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,970
it just happened that the the shyest

234
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,459
quietest girl in our group of friends

235
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:40,770
couldn't make it either and to this day

236
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:43,500
I don't know why I did something so

237
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,149
uncharacteristic for me at the time but

238
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,200
I called her up and asked her if she

239
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,120
wanted to go to a later show by the end

240
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,240
of the night shoot she was in my arms

241
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,730
um and after that things picked up for a

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,660
bit she was in charge of lighting of the

243
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:04,020
school play she got me to sign back up

244
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,540
for the play of the stagehand we talked

245
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,240
about colleges and she showed me all the

246
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,440
pamphlets she'd gotten they sent her a

247
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:20,339
lot she got a perfect score on the SATs

248
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:22,440
and I started getting out more and sort

249
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,560
of I mean she opened up in camp or

250
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:29,579
social - it was good um I cut down my

251
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,060
hours and my friend zoomed ahead of me

252
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:39,660
as we needed I think 30 maybe 35 on

253
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:42,899
EverQuest then one day they all showed

254
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,890
up at my door my friends my companions

255
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:49,050
of my long quest filled ours the first

256
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,380
thing I said to me was the expansion

257
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:56,279
packs out they came in and we started

258
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,170
talking about it and we were going to

259
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,760
re-roll and start new characters with a

260
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,339
new race they need someone to beat their

261
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,970
healer we talked about the new zones for

262
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:11,279
hours how they were so much faster XP

263
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,320
how we started plotting and how we could

264
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,140
improve faction

265
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,060
to make it to back the old continent

266
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,110
without being kill on sight if any of

267
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:30,370
you guys you guys ever remember Kunar um

268
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:32,050
and by the end of the evening they told

269
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,140
me they've got an extra copy shipped out

270
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:37,630
for me and I called the girl I loved and

271
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,900
told her I just I needed a weekend with

272
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,900
the guys

273
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:48,010
well while I've been gone they'd they'd

274
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,490
actually learnt Linux and built a

275
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,580
machine and got it a set up for show EQ

276
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:56,140
the programs program that reads packets

277
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,300
being sent from the server so they could

278
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,250
get all sorts of data like usable map

279
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:05,230
and monster spawn information all this

280
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:07,000
stuff it was a new experience we we were

281
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:09,670
so much faster and better at everything

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,570
the new race was powerful we started

283
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,450
blazing two levels and soon I was there

284
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:19,420
again pretty much every night um the

285
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:22,300
same pattern emerged I kind of let my

286
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:29,230
real life fall apart I'm not I'm not

287
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:32,380
ashamed of many things in my life but I

288
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,350
am ashamed of how I acted then um I let

289
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:41,200
a lot of people I cared about down I

290
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:44,440
missed a lot of important moments one

291
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,390
day my best friend's girlfriend came to

292
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,640
me in the hall and dragged me aside she

293
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,580
told me that the night before she had

294
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,080
been begging for him to come to bed and

295
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:56,680
instead he sat there looking at pictures

296
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:58,840
of the new zones by the time she was

297
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,480
done crying against my chest and telling

298
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,130
me how humiliating it was to not be able

299
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:09,970
to compete with a video game um how she

300
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:15,910
hated these things and the way she felt

301
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:18,339
I mean I went I went to comfort her

302
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,079
because I mean funny thing is this is

303
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,509
this is the girl that I would have

304
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,730
killed for this is to go who previously

305
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:30,850
before for meaning what I did um she was

306
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,360
the one who I stopped talking to my

307
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:39,819
closest friend for six months over and

308
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:45,610
yet as soon as she was done crying on my

309
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:48,430
shoulder I told her I talked to him but

310
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,149
I went back and told him exactly what

311
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,750
she said and then I helped plot with him

312
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,939
how he could smooth things over

313
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:05,379
while using his little time at EQ as

314
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:07,060
possible I mean I don't know I said it

315
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:09,639
but there are a few memories I'm ashamed

316
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,920
of I've always tried to live my life by

317
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,449
a pretty simple set of beliefs do as

318
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,230
little harm as possible to what good you

319
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:20,610
can and in fairness let nobody call you

320
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,329
hypocrite and that's pretty much it but

321
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,430
every time I think about that

322
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:29,800
conversation I just get this not my

323
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:32,170
guide and you know who you are but I

324
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,670
know you're not watching this but for

325
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:38,350
what it's worth I'm still sorry I'm

326
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:40,660
sorry until today umm the experience

327
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,220
though shook me even then I tried to

328
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,350
tell the girl I loved about how I was

329
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,449
struggling with this game instead I was

330
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,399
rambling I ended up telling her more

331
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:53,639
about the game and how hard it was to

332
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:56,949
pull away and even though I knew I

333
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,540
wanted to express to her that I I knew

334
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:01,660
I'd be happier spending more time with

335
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,439
him um and while I was rambling was and

336
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,840
him I was just telling her about

337
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:08,250
EverQuest

338
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,380
I telling her something about the city

339
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:18,560
of mists when she stopped me and said

340
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:22,320
James I think I might be pregnant this I

341
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,080
mean this was it I shook this was the

342
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,230
great damn reality crashing down and

343
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,970
floods rolled in I held her I told her

344
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,750
how much I loved her how I'd do anything

345
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,700
for her

346
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,790
I told her I'd get rid of all my stupid

347
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,340
games at night I felt so wretched and

348
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:40,350
pathetic and miserable she had been

349
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,970
acting odd for the last week I didn't

350
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,420
pick up on it because I was so wrapped

351
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:48,510
up in my fantasy world but it became

352
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:53,070
clear the moment she spoke it became

353
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:57,030
clear how much I've missed how much of

354
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,940
the empathy that my teachers and

355
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,590
directors used to laud before have been

356
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,460
cut off by this filter of another

357
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:10,050
existence I begged her to forgive me

358
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:11,670
I promised me more than I was luckily it

359
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,250
turned out she wasn't pregnant but the

360
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,840
experience got me to put away EQ and let

361
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,640
myself to console games I had time to

362
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,340
play it didn't go back to my friends

363
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,290
basement they got angry at me for

364
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,540
abandoning them they felt betrayed that

365
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:27,770
their healer had left when they were

366
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:30,510
just going to start doing city of mist

367
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,790
but I found that life will always

368
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:36,180
welcome you back this is the important

369
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,880
thing I I pulled up my grades I rejoined

370
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,240
theater group I picked up a guitar over

371
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,490
the summer I crammed hard for the SATs I

372
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,590
as fall rolled around I spent my

373
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,040
EverQuest hours writing and rewriting my

374
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:54,090
entrance essays I thought of getting

375
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,410
into college as an EQ quest um all the

376
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,410
skills I had thrown at the game

377
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,600
I found that life rewards you for using

378
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,250
them um you have to apply them to the

379
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,950
right thing and apply them as

380
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:09,540
tenaciously as you did when playing but

381
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:13,050
still life welcomes you back um I won't

382
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,299
ever say that everything was easy or it

383
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,539
was

384
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:19,119
perfect I won't say that I won every

385
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,340
battle with this iPod but I did end up

386
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,230
going to a college of my dreams we got

387
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,759
to play music in almost every state I

388
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:29,350
end up working on the games I love today

389
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,110
the man who designed the core systems

390
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,179
for EverQuest as a close friend the

391
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:36,999
buddy of mine we got a PC for we wrote

392
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:40,059
out Drori works at PopCap for blocks and

393
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:42,399
where I will live Richard Garriott

394
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:47,109
actually even wrote a chapter for book I

395
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:49,720
didn't invented languages heck I I've

396
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:53,679
actually even gotten to see almost every

397
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:58,029
sip wonder that's still standing life is

398
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:01,600
pretty good piece most importantly I'm

399
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:04,239
surrounded by people who I love and will

400
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,389
join me in all equation endeavours I do

401
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:09,639
I still treat each moment like I did

402
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:11,590
when playing at requests challenges to

403
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:13,929
be conquered through rigor and thought

404
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,429
and application I still pick a desired

405
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,190
goal for a lark and try and figure out

406
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:20,289
how to end up there whether it's being

407
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,879
independent designer or game to talk

408
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:26,409
about games every day of the week with

409
00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:29,320
awesome people I still grind life with

410
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:33,639
the work ethic to the game top but for

411
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,519
all its lessons um I paid too high a

412
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:38,499
price for them and my friend never

413
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:41,350
learnt them in the end he dropped out of

414
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:44,980
college before a year was up he couldn't

415
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,309
hold a steady job and he never moved out

416
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,950
of his parents basement um the last time

417
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:53,769
I heard of him was a few years back my

418
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,379
buddy at PopCap tried to get him a

419
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:59,649
tester position there and he lasted for

420
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:01,629
a few weeks um he sort of made gains

421
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:03,960
addiction games compulsion a self

422
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:06,070
compelling self-fulfilling prophecy he

423
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,070
life didn't live up to his expectations

424
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,779
so he turned from it towards games but

425
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,309
when life offered him opportunities at

426
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:14,440
the first sign of challenge he'd run

427
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,059
back to hiding mind games because he was

428
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,019
afraid that life would reject him again

429
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,410
but really life always welcomes you back

430
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:23,650
you

431
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,820
just can't run too soon I know dozens of

432
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,640
people who have struggled with the games

433
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,520
addiction every one of them who took

434
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,190
that terrifying first step of walking

435
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,140
boldly back into the real world despite

436
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:41,590
all the prospects of rejection and

437
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:43,990
failure were met with open arms once

438
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,100
you're past high school

439
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:50,740
maybe past college you'll find that life

440
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,510
embraces the gamer mindset that if you

441
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,930
use all those things that games taught

442
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:58,390
you and you fight for it the real world

443
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:04,180
has wonders it could never find in a

444
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:07,240
game so if I just I know this is going

445
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:13,390
on really long but a few more quick

446
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:15,670
things first if you do if you feel like

447
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,200
you do suffer from games of motion don't

448
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,230
think of the years that you've spent

449
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,970
playing games as wasted years don't ever

450
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,620
think of yourself as impossibly behind

451
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:28,240
it's not true there are always options

452
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,890
thinking this way it just serves as an

453
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,830
excuse to continue avoiding the real

454
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,740
life for games but you don't have to

455
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:39,280
life will welcome you back

456
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,080
second junkies put a push jump if one of

457
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,790
your friends is trying to ramp down on

458
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,830
their gaming or break free of something

459
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:47,920
they can start destructive don't lure

460
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,050
them back in this has happened to me and

461
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,970
I've done it at times it's bad news

462
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:58,630
don't do it I mean everyone I know who's

463
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:02,320
ever wrestled with this has a story

464
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:04,900
similar to mine where as soon as they

465
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,380
first broke free of their gaming

466
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,380
compulsion

467
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:18,520
it was their friends who brought them

468
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:22,270
back in so I mean I guess just don't be

469
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,760
that person we're more than that and

470
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,590
lastly you just know you're not alone I

471
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,120
mean if you suffer from game compulsion

472
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,260
this is something I didn't realize when

473
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:34,480
I was much younger but not you're not

474
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,450
alone not online and not in the real

475
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,670
world there are thousands people tens of

476
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,920

together and discuss these things and

493
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,970
share their stories and ask for help

494
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:34,860
when they need it so

495
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:38,250
I don't know I'm sorry that I couldn't

496
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:42,029
write the more clinical episode about

497
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:45,149
games addiction games compulsion that I

know the answers to any of this stuff

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,980
these questions are too obscure for any

wolf who's a scientist seriously what

37
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,000
kind of player will know this

where else does this game offer this is

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,630
Reggie to another game meant for multi

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,250
player you can't play it alone but then

41
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,050
you're just playing against yourself who

42
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,150
decided this game was a good idea

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,490
I can understand teams being educational

44
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,230
but this one takes it too far it focuses

45
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,840
more on the learning aspect and less on

46
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:56,360
actually being far wrong not to mention

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,650
the announcers a complete hack run it

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,700
reads the same stupid phrases over and

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,250
over just to make me angrier than

Lyrics:
Trapped beneath the ground…
Locked away where we won’t be found.
No one knows we’re here,
but the day draws near:

I will leave this place ending
All the fears I’ve faced.
If I could go free, would they
come recapture me?  And I
won’t forgive the pain
or forget the years
full of blood and tears.

No more shocks and burns.
No more tests, no more lessons learned!
Here we draw the line,
etched in blood of mine.

I will risk it all, for a
chance to breach these walls.
I would roll the dice; offer
any sacrifice! And I
won’t live one more day
with these broken gears
full of blood and tears.

So Baby
No more crying.
Only chaos.
No relying
on someone to save us.

If you only knew all the
things that I’ve been through!
If I had your soul, would it
lift me from this hole?  Be my
hands forever stained
with a thousand smears
from the blood and tears!","1

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,160
offer any sacrifice

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,240
and I won' live one more day

21
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,520
with these broken gears

22
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,600
full of blood and tears.

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,260
So Baby

24
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,140
No more crying!

25
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,880
Only chaos!

26
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:12,220
No relying on someone to save us!

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,860
If you only knew all the

28
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,020
things that I've been through!

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,180
If I had your soul, would it

30
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,940
lift me from this hole?

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,460
Be my hands forever stained

32
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,240
with a thousand smears

33
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,720
full of blood and -

34
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:20,260
tears!

35
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,460

Walt so crunchy Walt what she wants you

117
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,449
all it were Toby's wind club aka the the

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,860
anime about a high school swimming team

119
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:49,270
yeah if we made this video and didn't

120
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,610
try and dress as the car he's what would

121
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,690
be bad they would revolt so I just need

122
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,820
to plug this right now do you just

123
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,470
intend me to get my pillowcase over my

124
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,910
head or are we just gonna stand in

125
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,110
speedos in front of the camera that was

126
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,380
the plan but I think we would get

127
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,259

level of free cosplay but they have

176
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,990

spend job suicide we're in by anonymous

2
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,640
does anyone remember this bunch of

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,640
episode the Spongebob who could fly they

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,130
aired in March 2003 it was dubbed the

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
last episode by it's commercials based

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,080
on the episode storyline where patchy

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,590
the pirate uses a treasure map to find

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,510
the sponge of episode that he lost the

9
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,989
night before that episode it was aired I

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,420
was sick with nowhere virus I was

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,940
feeling too ill to fall asleep so I sit

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,130
up and watch TV

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,100
around 2:30 a.m. my stomach started to

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,160
settle so I plan to turn off the TV and

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,980
try to fall asleep but as I was reaching

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,910
for my remote control the opening for

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,040
spongers started to play special it was

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,660
my favorite show that at that time so I

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,300
couldn't miss out on watching it

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,009
although I thought it was kind of

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,170
strange that they were showing spunda of

22
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,240
in the middle of the night but I didn't

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,240
think much of it when the opening played

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,909
I noticed that the contrast of animation

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,560
was slightly darker than usual and the

26
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,689
theme song sounded a bit harsh and raspy

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,679
this made me feel a little bit

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,289
uncomfortable but I also tried brushing

29
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,899
that off the Teta called red lost

30
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:32,789
episode slowly figured that there was

31
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:35,009
like a mishap and nickelodeon was

32
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:39,270
accidentally airing the Spongebob who

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,369
can fly when this episode started

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,969
playing it immediately looked out of the

35
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,069
order of ordinary it started off with

36
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,049
sponge ruff sitting on his bed slouched

37
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:51,719
and looking down with a somber look on

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,749
his face this was definitely not like

39
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,229
himself spender is so optimistic all the

40
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:59,849
time why would he be acting like this

41
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:00,659
after about 10 seconds of seeing sponge

42
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,810
of it like this

43
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:08,580
he led of a big sigh then looked over to

44
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:10,470
his oversized bed barrel and the screen

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,890
zoomed in on the pill bottle that was

46
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,990
sitting beside his clock once a screen

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,910
zoomed and close enough to read the text

48
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,480
on the bottle it showed that was

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,830
a prozac bottle the show then panned to

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,930
a scene with though much brighter

51
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,300
contrast showing spongebob taking one of

52
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,980
those pills and then running off smiling

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,590
and laughing the fact that Sundra had to

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,670
take these pills to be well himself made

55
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,820
me feel uneasy

56
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,290
especially because mental disorders and

57
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,990
antidepressants are much more mature

58
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,360
themes that obviously should find a

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,810
place in any kids cartoons it should be

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,000
noted that this was seen on a TV show

61
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,770
intended for kids the screen then

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,200
flipped back to the original scene of

63
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,690
Spongebob looking distressed but at the

64
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,150
same time changing the contract back to

65
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,190
the darker one the screen froze on the

66
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,590
spandrel for a few seconds then

67
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,690
flickered to our new scene these hints

68
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,730
show us bunch of at his death the same

69
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,580
one that he was an episode of

70
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,180
procrastinations with his prozac bottle

71
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,160
a piece of paper and a pencil

72
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,470
in this scene instead of staying at one

73
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,350
contrast the colors kept flickering from

74
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,140
light to dark sponge of gripped the

75
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,090
pencil in his hand and tear roll down

76
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,640
his face the part that bothered me the

77
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,400
most was that he did it look like the

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,120
original blue cartoon Stella tears the

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,220
characters and spendable usually cry out

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,550
this tear looked completely realistic

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,780
and just there had been a drop of water

82
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,730
rolling down from my TV from his I spun

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,220
drive raped the tear from his up face

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,010
with a sleeve and began to write on a

85
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,190
piece of paper reading out loud what he

86
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,670
was writing I can't take it anymore he

87
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,680
said as soon as he got that sentence out

88
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,630
a faint noise started playing in the

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,390
background it sounded like a child

90
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,180
crying this noise contained him playing

91
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,190
as thunder to continue writing a life

92
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,739
has been horrible and hasn't gotten

93
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,959
better my bet from Patrick is only my

94
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,260
best friend because he doesn't know any

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,169
better

96
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,820
my neighbor squirt who hates my guts he

97
00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,700
would probably happy if I wasn't around

98
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,810
anymore spender of stop writing and

99
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,870
talking and started weeping loudly the

100
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:32,340
color flicking started getting faster

101
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,640
the cries in the barcode started getting

102
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,160
louder and it sounded more children were

103
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,160
beginning to cry and we could have just

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,990
been in my imagination but I remember

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,890
hearing one of the child's very feet me

106
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,960
yell he's gonna do it the children's

107
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,120
cries get louder and the colors kept

108
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,690
fluttering faster as thunder keeps

109
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,580
riding the only job I can get his beat

110
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,800
being the fire cook at the krusty krab

111
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,500
my boss mr. Krabs refuses to give me an

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,320
actual paycheck and he basically uses me

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,700
to get more customers I meant in my 20s

114
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,100
and I still don't have a driver's

115
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,640
license sandy is the only girl I ever

116
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:14,520
have had him a light and even she just a

117
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:18,120
friend she never had any interested in

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,120
me I'm pretty sure she's only friend

119
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,730
she's only my friend because she feels

120
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,370
sorry for me I'm sorry if I'm hurting

121
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,690
anyone at all for doing this but I just

122
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,270
can't live like this anymore

123
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,340
[Music]

124
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,900
the screen froze for a few seconds then

125
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,420
the show continued with spender I'm

126
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,370
writing his final sentence the counter

127
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,250
stayed dark instead of flickering from

128
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,890
light to dark the children stopped

129
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:47,970
crying it was absolute silence except

130
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:50,100
for spender saying goodbye the Christ

131
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,440
came back spending a bob quickly stood

132
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,310
up twisted off the lid on the pose a

133
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,410
quill bottle dipped and his head back

134
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:04,560
let off all of the pills in the bottle

135
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:06,870
full into his mouth and swallowed him

136
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,350
although the screen twitch and the

137
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,030
animation was darker but still visible

138
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,050
strand of a clutches stomach and vomited

139
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,760
realistic pale orange stomach bile it

140
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,000
was clear that his body was trying to

141
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,510
cleanse itself from the overdose but it

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,430
was no use

143
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,530
hundreds of collapse onto the floor and

144
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,970
lie there motionless until the screen

145
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,270
turned to static needless to say I was

146
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,210
scared of my mind

147
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,500
and the sleep was out of the question

148
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,900
recently I've been looking for this

00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:08,040
dr. Ivan Austral hired to research the

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,469
psychological effects of videogames then

long and becomes outraged he transforms

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:26,460
into the shuffle werewolf locked away by

those who hired him to keep their secret

at a younger age and having enjoyed them

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,800
I believe this game holds promise it

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,469
appears to revolve around horror themed

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:05,870
mini-games and the quality at first

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:05,870
glance appears abysmal let's begin

20
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:15,960
fantastic

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:20,759
admit one to the grand opening of horror

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,299
land where nightmares come to life hey

23
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,810

just leave it's just a dream great

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,350
gargantuan show where fear is the main

28
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,159
attraction

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,299
wow I'm moving it this is great

30
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,340
want to ride no wait don't do Milligan's

31
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:53,399
horrors and a mad dash through horror

land turn that rod into turbo or you'll

33
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,840
never catch up controls are a bit

34
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:02,230
finicky pick up the pace human wouldn't

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,460
want to be dead

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:21,730
last word that rhyme

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:39,510
that's right Wow okay hey this looks

38
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:39,510
simple if it's not the controller

39
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:57,630
yeah what are you kidding me what is up

40
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,630
with this season

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
yeah

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:45,209
this motion controls are terrible this

43
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,790
minigame is stupid

44
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,790
there's barely any skill involved at all

45
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,189
this game is impossible no matter how

46
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,700
good you are your boat still hits

47
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:07,700
everything

48
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,109
this one's decent but this game is the

49
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,229
same as the other one they just changed

50
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,510
how it looks make it slightly faster and

51
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:25,500
go through a different game you can't do

52
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:29,580
that mr. Blake trap boom come out hard

53
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:32,460
that side so is this game it's basically

54
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,740
the same as offering crews they took one

55
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,419
of the most obnoxious games and bring it

56
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,120
here twice why how could they be so lazy

57
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:45,770
it's a game based on regions and you

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,770
could even create all unique ones

59
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:50,670
and those aren't the only ones that are

60
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,430
risking of the same game the back of the

61
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,040
stupid game box sits 30 thrilling rides

62
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,430
and games but in reality it's only about

63
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:12,780
15 games and 15 copies of the same

64
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:14,760
stupid miserable games how are you even

65
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,360
supposed to complete this game when I'm

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,160
breaking your arm in the process Oh

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,110
minigames with a game itself controls

68
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,560
your movement and all you have to do is

69
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,720
aim and shoot are passable but anything

70
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,760
where you have to rely on the quality of

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,910
the motion controls maybe you want to

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,760
disallow myself with my own claws the

73
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,890
story is flat the graphics are on the

74
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,050
voice acting makes my ears bleed and

75
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,540
most importantly the gameplay is

76
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,930
complete and utter trash I hate this

77
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:48,210
game it's terrible how dare they put the

78
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,360
goosebumps name on this and more people

79
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,810
in the body may their other regions burn

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,810
for all eternity

81
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,470
I'm so sick of HorrorLand

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,160
Hey guys, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,019
I got so many requests to make something Warcraft
themed, the Warcraft movie just came

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,999
out and I have a lot of friends who play Warcraft
and World of Warcraft.

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,939
I am a huge fan of Blizzard games and I am
dressed up as a Gnome!

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,700
Which are my favorite playable characters.
They are very petite, they’re tinkerers

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,099
and they’ve got a Steampunk style!

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,320
I feel like if I was a Warcraft character
in real life I would be a Gnome!

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,040
Today we are gonna be making traditional Warcraft
Horde and Alliance themed cookies!

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Let’s get started!

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,300
The things you will need, will be: 3 cups
of all purpose flour, 2 sticks of butter,

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,030
1-1/2 cups of sugar, 1 teaspoon of baking
powder, 1/8 teaspoon of salt,

12
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,720
1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 2 eggs. Then you will
also need 4 different colors of royal

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,920
icing, I’ve dyed them black, blue, yellow
and red. And a circle cookie cutter.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,220
Now let’s put it all together!

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,580
The recipe that we’re using today is an
adaptation from my lemon sugar cookie recipe

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,960
from the Nerdy Nummies Cookbook. The first
thing that we’re gonna do is we’re gonna

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,530
combine our dry ingredients into this bowl.
We’re gonna add our flour, salt and

18
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,000
baking powder. Then we’re gonna whisk it
together until it’s well combined.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Next we’re gonna cream together our butter
and sugar into a big mixing bowl.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,500
So I’m gonna put in my butter, add your
sugar, now I’m gonna mix together

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,360
until our mixture is light and fluffy. I’m
using my Wiz-o-Matic 5000!

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,680
Or you can use a hand mixer, whatever you
got!

23
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,600
It’s light and fluffy, now we’re gonna
add our eggs.

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,580
We’re gonna add them 1 at a time, add the
egg, mix it up, scrape down,

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,270
then add your second egg, mix it up and scrape
down again.

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,570
Then add your vanilla extract and mix it up
1 more time!

27
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,760
Our wet ingredients are all mixed up and now
we are gonna pour in all

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,729
of our dry ingredients. And now we’re gonna
mix it together, but you want to make

29
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,240
sure it’s on a low speed, otherwise you’ll
get a big dust cloud!

30
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,659
Our cookie dough is mixed and it’s ready
to chill, we’re gonna wrap it up in

31
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,489
plastic wrap. Now I’m gonna put this into
the fridge and let it chill for about 2 hours.

32
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,639
Our dough has sat in the fridge, it’s chilled,
and now it’s ready to roll out.

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,579
We’re gonna unwrap our dough…. Yes!

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,000
We’re gonna take a little bit of flour,
sprinkle it on top of our work surface

35
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,529
so that the dough doesn’t stick. And I’m
going to be cutting my dough in 1/2

36
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:27,060
and rolling it out 1/2 at a time so it’s
a little bit easier to work with!

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,340
Sprinkle a little flour on top, and on your
rolling pin, and get to rolling!

38
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,260
We’re gonna roll it out about 1/4 inch thick.

39
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,340
Now we’re gonna cut out our cookies, take
your circle cookie cutter, and cut out

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,950
as many as you can. Remove your excess dough.
I’m gonna place these on a baking

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,279
sheet lined with parchment paper, this recipe
doesn’t spread very much, it

42
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,319
really holds shape, so you can put these cookies
pretty close.

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,269
Once you’ve got your cookies on the tray,
we are gonna bake them, you’re gonna heat

44
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:58,090
your oven to 350 degrees and bake for about
12-14 minutes.

45
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,269
While the oven is pre-heating, this part is
totally optional, but I’m gonna pop

46
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,869
these cookies in the freezer to help hold
their shape while they bake.

47
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:08,940
While our cookies are baking, we are going
to make some decoration details,

48
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,409
These take a long time to set, so if you want
to make these the night before,

49
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,169
you can do that, they take anywhere from 8-12
hours. You want to let them sit at room temperature.

50
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,159
Here I’ve made 2 templates in photoshop,
1 is a bunch of Horde symbols, and

51
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,699
1 is a bunch of Alliance symbols, I’ll put
a link down below so if you want to use

52
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,639
these templates that I’ve made, you can!

53
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,129
Or if you’d like to make your own you can
do that as well.

54
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,309
I placed the piece of paper down on top of
a cutting board, so I could move it around

55
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:39,499
if I needed to, and then you’re gonna place
a piece of wax paper, right on top.

56
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:40,239
And tape it down!

57
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,790
I’m gonna start by piping the Horde symbol
first, and again, I’m using royal icing

58
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,330
that I’ve dyed red, I’ve just placed it
into a plastic baggie with a number 2 tip.

59
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,020
When you're piping htese, Just take your time, I like to pipe the outside of the outline first and then fill

60
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:56,629
it in. Then move the icing around with a little
toothpick.

61
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,510
Got all of our Horde Designs done, and now
I’m gonna set these off to the side

62
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,249
because I don’t want to bump them while
I’m piping the Alliance.

63
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:06,749
That’s the worst thing! When you’ve piped
all your cute designs and you bump ‘em

64
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:07,639
with your elbow….

65
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,540
I’ve done that…..

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,499
To pipe our alliance symbols, I’m gonna
be using the yellow royal icing, and again,

67
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:19,039
I’m using a number 2 tip. I’m gonna be
tracing and filling in all of the white parts

68
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,280
of the design. Once you’re done we’re
gonna let these sit out at room temperature,

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,490
not in the refrigerator, just at room temperature
for 8-12 hours to completely dry.

70
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,330
While our designs are drying we are gonna
ice our cookies.

71
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,180
Our cookies are fresh out of the oven, I’ve
given them plenty of time to cool.

72
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,349
You don’t want to ice your cookies while
they’re still warm, otherwise the icing

73
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,990
will goop off, it will just kind of, like,
melt.

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,720
You don’t want that!

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,220
We’re gonna be icing 1/2 of them black,
and 1/2 of them blue.

76
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,409
I’m gonna start with the black royal icing,
I put it into a plastic baggie with a

77
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,310
number 3 tip. Little bit bigger this time.

78
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,690
And we’re gonna pipe an outline, all the
way around the cookie.

79
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,520
Now for the blue, we’re gonna do the same
thing, pipe an outline all the way

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,449
around our cookie. Next we are going to flood
our cookies.

81
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:06,659
Flooding is just when you fill in the cookie.
So I like to make zig-zags,

82
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:11,069
I go back and forth. Then I'm gonna take
a toothpick to just smooth out the icing.

83
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,500
Then you’re gonna do this to the rest of
your cookies!

84
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,270
Once you’ve iced all of your cookies we’re
gonna let them sit out for about 10-20

85
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,479
minutes to set. Final step, it is time to
assemble our cookies!

86
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,840
I’m going to be placing our red Horde designs
on top of our black cookies.

87
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,939
And, our Alliance designs on top of our blue
cookies!

88
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,460
Over here I’ve got our designs, they have
dried, what I like to do is take a pair of

89
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,370
scissors, cut them out, don’t bend them,
and then with 1 of the shapes I’m gonna

90
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,039
very carefully, I like to get down here.

91
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,550
Get even shorter!

92
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,450
Using the edge of the table to gently remove
the design from the wax paper.

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,440
And I’m gonna be using a sharp cutting knife,
like this, to catch it.

94
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,920
Gently pick it up and place it on top of your
cookie.

95
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,710
If you don’t want to deal with a sharp cutting knife
you can use a small off-set spatula,

96
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,909
You gotta go really fast, you press down your
spatula, and shoot it underneath!

97
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,169
It’s real fast, like a ninja!

98
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,759
Lift, and transfer!

99
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,870
Last detail, I almost forgot, we’re gonna
pipe the Lion’s little nose!

100
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,479
Over here I’ve switched to a number 1 tip,
just a little triangle right there,

101
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,090
and we’re gonna do this to the rest of our
cookies.

102
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,640
Ta-da!

103
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,520
Here are the traditional Warcraft Horde and
Alliance themed cookies that we made today!

104
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,879
Whether you are for the Horde! Or for the
Alliance!

105
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,080
We’ve got some yummy treats! And a big thank
you to you guys for suggesting something

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,919
Warcraft themed, these were very fun and easy
to make!

107
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,969
I’ll be taking lots of pictures of these
cookies and posting them on Facebook,

108
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,889
Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram! And if you
guys make any themed Warcraft treats,

109
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,840
please take a picture and send it to me! I
love seeing your baking creations,

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,300
I just get a big kick out of it. It makes
my day!

111
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,539
And, if you have any other ideas for any other
Nerdy Nummies, please let me know

112
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,479
leave me a comment down below and I will do
my best to make it happen.

113
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,079
Alright, thanks again, bye-bye!

00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:06,477
Hey what's up everybody in this video we're actually not going to be programming in Python. Surprise!

2
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:10,843
We are actually going to be playing a game; Minesweeper

3
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:16,511
So how does Minesweeper work? If you guys are wondering how to access this game.

4
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:20,513
You can just click you're start menu and search Minesweeper

5
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:24,513
Or you can search in all programs and find games somewhere.

6
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:28,514
If you still don't have you might be able to find it online somewhere. Who knows.

7
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:34,614
Anyways let me move this start menu out of the way and let's get on to our gaming experience.

8
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:38,881
I'm just using this white as a background. Alright Minesweeper.

9
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:43,848
So the goal of this game there is basically a whole bunch of mines on this field alright

10
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,850
and we have to figure out which one of these blocks

11
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,650
are mines. There is 10 of them. We're on easy. If you go to new game

12
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:57,817
Or I'm sorry, options. It will tell you the difficulty.

13
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:01,819
Alright so what we do. First we just randomly click.

14
00:01:01,819 --> 00:01:06,319
And you see it discovered a whole bunch of the map. Now when you see a number

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,286
That means there is a mine in this box.

16
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:17,186
Basically this clear box is touching a mine.

17
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:21,420
So it can be any of these boxes; this one, this one, this one, this one, this one, this one

18
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:26,122
this one, this one. Basically it's being surounded by a mine somewhere

19
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:30,522
and because there is only one that's not already discovered.

20
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,556
We know for sure that this is a mine.

21
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:37,789
because it's touching this box and it's the only box touching this box.

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,790
and this box says that a mine is touching it. Therefore

23
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:45,791
Due to logic we can assume that that is a mine. Now this box

24
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:49,791
let's take a look. We'll any box surrounding it. One, two, three four. Oh! Well see

25
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:53,792
we know this is a mine and it's only touching one mine.

26
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:57,792
and it can be cornered like this. So that means that this one

27
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:01,793
has to not be a mine. Otherwise this would be a 2.

28
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,259
<click>

29
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:07,261
Alright so you see the same thing here. So we look around this 1. 

30
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:12,727
and you can see that there is only one mine. Therefore we know that these 2 are not mines.

31
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,729
Now we have this one. Let's look around this one. Once again

32
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:20,729
This is the only mine beside this one <click> <click>

33
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,230
Now for the 2. We go all the way around. da da da da da and you can see

34
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:30,964
that there is two mines. It's telling us that there is 2. That means this has to be a mine.

35
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:34,964
cause it's the only other box the 2 is touching. So by the way

36
00:02:34,965 --> 00:02:40,065
to flag it we can just right click. That will help us remember that those are mines, don't click them. 

37
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:44,066
Now  let's look at this 3. Well three mines; One.. Two..

38
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,066
There is only three boxes so that means all three of these are mines.

39
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:54,200
Let's try this box and once again three boxes therefore this one is a mine. Let's try this box.

40
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:58,701
Ok well now we have one two and then we have more boxes

41
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:04,601
then this number. That means one of these is a mine and we're not exactly sure which one

42
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:10,035
If you want you can lable them question mark. But I prefer to keep them clear until

43
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:14,203
I get back to them. So let's start somewhere else.

44
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:18,036
Let's start with this box here. Alrigh so let's look around it.

45
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:21,338
This block, nope. This one? nope. nope. 

46
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:26,471
Alright so that means this has to be a mine because it's the only box in the square around it.

47
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:31,238
Alright so let's try this one. Yep. So that means this one is not a mine.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,373
Let's try this one. It would go this way

49
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:40,373
Because that means this one is a mine and this is not a mine

50
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:47,907
This 1. Well around the one. There is only one box. Therefore that is a mine.

51
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:52,908
Now this one is a four and there is 4 boxes. Therefore we know

52
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:57,809
That these are mines. And we've used all of our flags. Therefore I can assume

53
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,043
That these are all mines. Now if you're playing on Extreme difficulty you might want to check

54
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:06,244
To try to make sure you got it all right. I'm just going to click.

55
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:10,411
And we have one left, boom! <clap> that's right.

56
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:13,811
You just officially completed you're first game of Minesweeper.

57
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,112
No more being confused at this weird mine game.

58
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:20,078
Now you know how to play and how to win.

59
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,080
So once you get bored of it you can click games.

60
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,380
Options, and then click advanced.

61
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:31,047
And now, oh yeah buddy! I am going to play this whole thing

62
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:35,048
With each.. awhh. You can try it on this if you

63
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:38,049
are up for the challenge. So that's all I have to say.

64
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:41,082
Thank you for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video.

Lyrics for The Party Called Vox Machina:
[GILMORE]
How did a plastered, or-der-less, party of gits,
with no patience, a tendency to break shit, go on and save
Exandria, surviving, thank divine intervention, till they arose
Tal’Dorei’s revolutionary heroes.

[ALLURA]
Vex’ahlia and Vax’ildan, whose Father couldn’t bother,
Swore to get richer by talking a lot slicker
By moving a lot quicker, By raising a tough critter
as     mere         teens.
The twins are close, they share a heart when they don’t bicker.

[KIMA]
While villages were slaughtered, and pillaged across the plains
The goliath Grog struggled with his conscience, found a waver
inside himself, longin’ to be part of something greater but
if he bowed out, his Herd of Storms would mark him as a traitor

[ALLURA]
(When-the) Briarwoods came, and devastation reigned
Young Percy saw his family die, nearly went insane
While schemin’ with a demon, smoke tendrils through his brain,
He built his first pistol, a testament to his pain

[KIMA]
Pike Trickfoot, a cleric, little lady is a monstah!
Prayin’, genuflectin’ cuz’ her goddess really wants her
To spread her light and love -

[GILMORE]
-but wait we can’t forget the bardster,
Who never lets it rest with his libido, whatchu called, sir?

[SCANLAN]
Scanlan Shorthalt, I’m a gnome
My name is Scanlan Shorthalt, I’m a gnome
And there’s a million chicks I haven’t boned
But just you wait, just you wait

[ALLURA]
(Pike’s-great) great grandfather in trouble outside of Westruun 
Few hours later, a goliath on her step festrin’
Half-dead, beat’n down defendin’ Wilhand from Storm kin

[ENSEMBLE] (whisper)
She nurses Grog to health,
But the herd is in the wind.

[KIMA and (ENSEMBLE)]
Keyleth felt a smother, her mother lost on a sacred trial
Left her with a destiny to unite the Ashari tribe
(her people said) “Keyleth’s gotta lead us, it’s her turn”
She started lookin’ for adventure cuz she had some things to learn

[GILMORE and (ENSEMBLE)]
They wouldn’t have made it far
If it had not been for this group
They woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution. Started workin’,
journeyin’ together as the SHITS
Tradin’ out pain and sufferin’, for problems they could fix
(Scammin’) for every gold piece Vex had her eye on
(Plannin’) for the future, see Greyskull outside of Emon? (oooh)
Symbol     of-a-group headed for wealth and true fame
For-the-future, they should really consider a new name…

[VOX MACHINA]
In Emon we’ll make up a new name (Just you wait)
In Emon we’ll take up a new name (Just you wait)
For Emon we’ll take up a new name


[COMPANY, WOMEN]
For Emon

[COMPANY, MEN]
Emon

[GILMORE]
Just you wait

[ENSEMBLE 1]            [ENSEMBLE 2]
The party called Vox Machina    (party called Vox Machina)
Fate is pulling the strings for you    (fate is pulling the strings)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time
The, party called Vox Machina    (party called Vox Machina)
When Exandria sings of you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

[ALLURA]                            [ENSEMBLE]
There’s heroes in the city now, see if you can spot ‘em,    (just you wait)
Adventurers we celebrate, climbin’ up from the bottom
Their enemies know well their name, their backs, allies’ve got ‘em

[KIMA / ALLURA / GILMORE]
We fought with them


[KIMA / ALLURA]
We would die for them

[KIMA]
Me? I trusted them

[ALLURA]
Me? I loved them

[GILMORE] (casual, talking delivery)
And me?
I’m the damn fool that sponsored ‘em


[VOX MACHINA]
There’s a million things we haven’t done
But just you wait


[GILMORE]
What’s your name?

294,Crafts With Sharpies | Tay from Millennial Moms,OzNaFmuNML4,"Today's DIY is crafts with sharpies! Sharpies work great for being permanent but they also have a chemical makeup that makes them fun to use for these cool projects. Tie dye shirts and removable labels are really fun and super easy to create.

I'm Tay from Millennial Moms and I post DIY projects every Tuesday!

(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,651
Hey guys, welcome to Millennial Moms.

3
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:20,651
I'm Tay, so that means it's Tues-Tay.

4
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,451
And we wanted to show you guys

5
00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:25,984
a couple of crafts you
can do with Sharpies.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,287
Now before we get started,

7
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:29,051
don't forget to click subscribe and like

because we love you

9
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,650
and you should love us, too.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,764
Alright, let's go, ready, go.

11
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,417
Alright guys, here's two awesome ways

12
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,544
to use Sharpies or any permanent marker.

13
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:38,552
For a sleep-over or when you just

14
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:40,217
have some friends over it's really fun

15
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,818
to make your own tie-dye shirts.

16
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:43,718
So we just got these cute white t-shirts

17
00:00:43,718 --> 00:00:44,917
from a local store.

18
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:47,218
They were actually on
clearance for two dollars each.

19
00:00:47,218 --> 00:00:49,018
And then I just let the kids design

20
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:52,117
their own drawings all over the shirt.

21
00:00:52,117 --> 00:00:54,351
I didn't tell them what to draw.

22
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,316
They just kind of came
up with what they wanted.

23
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:59,751
And it's really fun to put
the colors next to each other.

24
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:01,857
And you're just gonna put some

25
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:03,418
alcohol into a spray bottle

26
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,550
and spray it in a ventilated
area like outdoors

27
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,984
and let it dry.

28
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,983
And then it makes a
really cute tie-dye shirt.

29
00:01:10,983 --> 00:01:13,052
So another way that I love to use Sharpies

30
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:17,258
is to label everything and I
love these dollar store tins.

31
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:19,518
Target always has them in the dollar spot.

32
00:01:19,518 --> 00:01:21,984
And you can label them

33
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:25,217
but if you don't like it you
can just use a dry-erase marker

34
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:27,417
to take it off and re-label
it as something else.

35
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,917
And then, obviously,
Mason jars are amazing

36
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,484
so I like to just mix a color inside.

37
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:37,558
This one I'm just using
pink, or red, blue, and white

38
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:39,751
to make a light lavender-ish color.

39
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,475
And then just label it.

40
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,990
OK guys, I hope you loved that tutorial.

41
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,351
If you guys want to see
more crafts that kids can do

42
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,684
let me know in the comments.

43
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:55,051
If you want to see less or more of me,

44
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:56,351
I guess you'd only see more of me,

45
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,383
but go on over to Auntie Tay

46
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:00,184
cuz I upload Mondays and Wednesdays,

47
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:03,884
but Millennial Moms uploads
Mondays through Saturdays.

48
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,318

11
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,179
freshly washed and conditioned hair I

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,320
used Tresemme shampoo and conditioner

13
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:03,539
I'll leave the full name in the

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,309
description box below but right now I'm

15
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,440
just going to section my hair off I'm

16
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,930
going to pin up two sections in the

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,560
front and leave one section down in the

18
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,160
back for me to work with and my hair is

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,930
about 80% dry right now but I'm going to

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,750
add a little bit of water so there's my

21
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,010
spray bottle full of water and I'm just

22
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,260
going to add a little bit I feel like my

23
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,420
watching gos turn out better on dry your

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,190
hair but I do like it a little damp when

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm mixing my leave-in conditioner it

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,300
helps it to absorb the better and there

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,010
is my leave-in

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,740
that's my Cantu shea butter leave-in

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,020
conditioning repair cream and I do like

30
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,970
to add a lot of this to my hair

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,010
but it keeps my hair moisturized all

32
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,780
seven days like look at how like shiny

33
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,170
my hair is so I went from like really

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,960
dry to really shiny and I do add a lot

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,060
of this but it does not dry with that

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,100
white cast on it and it doesn't leave

37
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,560
any flakes also like I hate hate hate

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,640
flakes so this does not leave any flakes

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,460
or anything on my hair

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,980
and there is my paddle brush so I'm just

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,650
going to run that through my hair a

42
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,330
little bit my hair is already detangle

43
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,370
so I'm not using this like to comb my

44
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,379
hair out or anything I'm using it to

45
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,629
make sure that the conditioner or the

46
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,750
leave-in conditioner gets on every

47
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:23,010
single strand of my hair and look how

48
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,340
shiny it is I love this stuff is so good

49
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,250
and there is my favorite gel that is my

50
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,379
eco styler gel and I love that gel but

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,469
that one specifically is like so hard to

52
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:35,999
find it like runs out and the stores or

53
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:38,280
sells out in the stores like really

54
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:41,159
really fast so you have to like stock

55
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,650
walmart.com to be able to find it at

56
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,969
least where I live in Florida but I'm

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,650
just going to break that through my hair

58
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,969
and I use a lot of this product too but

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,829
this one does not leave any flakes

60
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:52,079
either so I love this product

61
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:54,450
combination let me know what this combo

62
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:55,950
works for you it works for me like every

63
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,530
single time I look at how shiny and

64
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,200
bouncy my hair is and I'm just gonna

65
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,849
repeat these same steps all over my hair

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,530
so I'm just going to speed this up a

67
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,780
little bit but I'll be back to chat with

68
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,210

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm just splitting that section into two

75
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,720
sections and I'm just going to pin one

76
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,940
away and leave the other one out to work

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,320
with so when I'm at the top of my hair I

78
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,169
do things a little differently

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,870
I work in smaller sections and I also

80
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:22,490
rake my breaks of product through my

81
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,410
hair a little bit differently so I'm

82
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,300
using the same products the water the

83
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,760
leave-in conditioner and then the eco

84
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,890
styler gel but what I do differently in

85
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,890
the front is I'm after I finished raking

86
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,590
I then go in and finger coil each

87
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,690
section around my fingers so I do this

88
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,610
in the front because I really like my

89
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,220
curls to be popping in the front when I

90
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,560
take my selfies and in the back of my

91
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,150
hair I'm does this on its own but in the

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,640
front of my hair I have a little bit of

93
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,890
a looser texture so I just wrap it

94
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,080
around my fingers and this also will

95
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,870
help me eliminate any frizz that may

96
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,610
happen in the front so by making sure

97
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,070
that it's like each strand is like

98
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,070
really coated I don't get as much frizz

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,840
when I'm doing or when it dries so I

100
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,720
love doing this look at how shiny my

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,700
hair looks already and look at how much

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,150
like body and how much bounce it has

103
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,680
already and it's wet still like yes it's

104
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,270
gonna be a pop and wash and go this is

105
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,600
like me get to this point you know if

106
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,280
all of your work is in vain you know but

107
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,800
it looks really really good right here

108
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,419
so I'm just going to speed this up I'll

109
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,419

all right y'all I'm back so for this

119
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,220
very last part I like to go in and make

120
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,320
sure that my edges are laying down and

121
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,720
that my hair is going to fall only to

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,940
the side I used to wear it like towards

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,860
the front like over my forehead but my

124
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,320
hair has gotten too long so I either put

125
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,910
it in the middle or I choose a side so

126
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,620
this is my side you guys should choose

127
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,139
whatever side works best for your face

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,930
or whatever side you like I just like to

129
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,660
put my hair all to the right size and I

130
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,360
just go in with that eco styler gel just

131
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,910
make sure that every little edge is

132
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,830
laying down and I do not need any bobby

133
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,530
pins or any clips to keep my hair laying

134
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,320
down with this gel like it's so good and

135
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,150
it won't dry crunchy or hard it'll just

136
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,070
stay in place like this and yeah look at

137
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,280

138
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,930

get into a spaceship and fly high up

83
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,720
into the air and go and visit every

84
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,150

food they have on other planets like is

89
00:05:49,260 --> 00:06:01,200
Mars made of just chocolate there would

90
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,530
be rivers of chocolate ABCs of chocolate

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:09,710
yeah there be rain and some pops and

92
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:15,630
pools of guacamole I like Emily

93
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:21,030
why not I think it would be really good

94
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:24,720
that sounds so very adventurous means

95
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,430
welcome only and chocolate mm-hmm if I

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
was gonna have chocolate with anything

97
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,160
I'd have it with cheese well you need to

98
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,840
first of all eat all that because I'm

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,690
not going to take you to space if you're

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,030
not a strong astronaut I need strong

101
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,360
astronauts in case we get into like into

102
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,120
trouble with an alien and we have to run

103
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,710
really fast away from an alien stuff I

104
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:58,520
don't know maybe they wouldn't they can

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:58,520
take take what's T you know space-time I

106
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,070
wonder if we were eating in space would

107
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:11,550
our food be floating

108
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:20,610
mm-hmm can you imagine what if our peers

109
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:22,770
are floating now this is really nice

110
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:30,120
yeah I like the peas the most of my past

111
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:32,340
episodes why yeah I love these yeah I

112
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,380
think the peas are really really good

113
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,530
for making you strong are they why is

114
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,890
that I think each one of them is packed

115
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,660
with lots of little muscles so when you

116
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:44,760
eat them they go into your muscles and

117
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,800
make the muscles bigger I have read them

118
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,060
all I want to be able to lift that box

119
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,400
by the end of today we'll be careful

120
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,300
though some of its really hot yes you

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:03,450
have to blow on it if it's hot you have

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,930
to do a long particulars what are you

123
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,630

124
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:11,810

Parcells our brand that makes this and

about rainbows and I had Custer in my

137
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,620
mouth oh I think each color would be a

138
00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,000
different flavor mm-hmm so I think red

139
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:03,630
would be strawberry yes absolutely

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,140
purple would be great flavor hmm yeah

141
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,760

143
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,080

336,Berserk: Guts Body Paint Cosplay Tutorial (NoBlandMakeup),qzGF7HccyiE,"Hey guys!

My last body paint of the year :D. This one is also my first manga/anime body paint tutorial. I also got someone to sit still for an hour so I could do it, so bonus points to Mike for being a boss :D.

So what the hell made me want to do this? Mike asked nicely? That's actually basically what happened lol. I'm also trying to get through my long ass list of stuff I said I was going to do this year at some point... it's a really long list. I'm also going to try extra hard to post more regularly and not go on random long ass hiatuses.

So who is Guts? A very complicated individual. Without spoilers (in case anyone wants to watch the show), he's a badass swordsman, with a gigantic sword and a really pissy attitude, granted after watching the show you can't really blame him... yeah without spoilers that's basically all I've got lol.

My next video is going to be my year in review, so if you guys would like to see anything for next year, leave me a comment letting me know!

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,279
Hey guys, so this is Mike.

2
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,279
Mike is about to pretend like he's not about
to have alot of fun.

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,279
We shall see!!

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,279
Alright, so to start off I just painted his
face white just to give myself a base and

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,500
this is going to make my life alot easier
when I decide to go over everything with black

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,670
to do line work and stuff.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,429
Plus then I on't have to go around everything.

8
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:38,190
Don't forget to do your ears, and any part
of your neck that will definitely for sure

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,680
be white.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:53,730
Also don't forget your eyelids and stuff.

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,629
Then I went in and filled in his eyes... eyebrows,
with black body paint and just started shaping

12
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:07,290
them like Guts in the picture that I will
have linked somewhere... probably down below!

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,630
Check it out!

14
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,130
I also started messing with his eye shape
and basically adding a little bit of detail

15
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,360
so he looks more manga-y.

16
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,310
This is actually my first manga body paint
thing, and it was...

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,450
I think it came out pretty cool so yeah.

18
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:33,740
I didn't do too much shading right now just
because I was kind of going to go with it

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,790
and see how it looked, and also I was going
to change some stuff later so don't worry

20
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,790
about it :D.

21
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:37,790
Now Guts has some pointy spikey bangs.

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,920
I went ahead and did those first and then
I worried about painting the rest of his hair.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
I just wanted to get that shape first.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,409
Also make sure that when you are connecting
everything that you make it look a little

25
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,399
more fluid than just some weird spikey lines.Also
don't forget to outline your ears and stuff

26
00:01:47,399 --> 00:02:43,670
just like you would for the rest of your face
because that's what the cool kids do.

27
00:02:43,670 --> 00:03:07,217
I then started applying my shading and stuff
and also reshaping- sort of- his mouth.

28
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:08,217
Guts doesn't smile and when he does it's kind
of creepy.

29
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:09,217
Then I started working on his neck also shading
in stuff and then drawing in the scarf...

30
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,960
bandanna... whatever you want to call it,
thing he had.

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,380
I didn't worry so much about shading again,
I just wanted to get the shapes right and

32
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,380
all the dark pieces first.

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,380
Then I was going to fill everything in with
white, and then do some more shading and stuff.

34
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,380
I'm going to say I find when you do more complicated
body paints like this, doing little things

35
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
at a time actually does help make things alot
easier.

36
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,720
And surprisingly this whole thing, minus breaks
so that I could like walk around and stuff,

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,069
took about an hour.

38
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,010
And by the way if you guys like his tattoo,
you can get it- if you're in or near Deerfield,

39
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,593
you can get it done at Wizard's Tattoo, and
I'll have it linked down below.

40
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:41,330
And I'm really, really sorry that I covered
it, but I had to.

41
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:47,060
Seriously though, his tat was awesome.

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:56,060
And like I said, I went in with white, not
so much worrying about shading and stuff,

43
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:14,549
just trying to do the major parts and then
worrying about it later.

44
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:24,940
Then I filled in the rest of his chest area
because that was mostly gonna be where the

45
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,650
knives and stuff wee going to be and it's
going to be alot of shading.

46
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:43,289
So I figured I'd save myself the headache
and do it now.

47
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:49,430
Then, like for anything else, if you're going
to do this based off a character, get a reference

48
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,430
picture.

49
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,699
It will make your life so much easier.

50
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,650
Especially when he has ten thousand knives
coming out of his.

51
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:06,660
Then I started doing the shading part.

52
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:34,919
This was honestly the most fun and it really
made everything come together.

53
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,050
Like, I'm not even kidding.

54
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,729
Basically I just drew little, kind of like
straight sketchy lines.

55
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,360
Nothing too specific or detailed or anything.

56
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:51,180
Just kinf od to give it a little bit of shadow
while still looking like a manga.

57
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,070
I'm guessing if you guys are watching this
video you've probably read a couple mangas

58
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,070
at some point.

59
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,900
And then I went back on his face and started
adding a little bit more shading and stuff

60
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
where I felt like he needed it.

61
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
At this point you can basically just kind
of fidget with the body paint and decide what

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
looks better.

63
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,900
For me his hair looked a little too plain.

64
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I also fixed his eye because Guts at one point
has a messed up eye.

65
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
But that is it!

66
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,550
kind of got from somewhere else on a

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,800
different platform but I mean if you

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,260
have a version and it went mental I

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,719
think that every youtuber has done you

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,180
to whisper chimes I'm oh you know get

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,770

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,980

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,050

20
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:53,780

in the question so that is the other way

25
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,540
around because I don't know I feel like

00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,820
some people know other people better and

27
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,420
we've gotta make it fair but if we get

28
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:10,850
the question wrong or if we don't answer

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,640
it all we get an egg smash on our head

30
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,530
yeah and hence why we're switching it

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,409
around so everybody hopefully gets at

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,449
hey guys so today I'm gonna be talking

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,740
about the most annoying types of friends

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,330
and I know that sounds really bad

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,859
because you aren't calling your friends

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,059
annoying let's be real for a second

6
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,650
every single friend of yours probably

7
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,240
does at least one thing that annoys you

8
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,469
but you just look past it because well

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,940
if they're your friend either that or

10
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,430
you haven't been friends long enough to

11
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,800
see those traits come out or well you

12
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,609
don't have any friends you would know a

13
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,380
lot about that huh

14
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,730

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,490
yeah and that's why you're talking to me

17
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,840
right now you talked to me first that's

18
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,510
why I'm talking to you yeah but

19
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,579

20
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,840

21
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,030

22
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,410
video since you have no friends yeah but

23
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,730

26
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,140
we already started is this not the first

27
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,210
example is it's not the whiny annoying

28
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,739
vlogger friend anyway as I was saying

29
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,270
until I still rudely interrupted myself

30
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,680
I love my friends I'm sure you guys know

31
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,539
Paul of yours that's why we call them

32
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,070
friends but there's no such thing as a

33
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,539
friend that's never annoying there's

34
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,800
just friends that are significantly less

35
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,090
annoying than others and today we're

36
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,800
gonna be talking about those others here

37
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,160
are the most annoying types of friends

38
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,160
take a look

39
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,580
this is one of the most relatable common

40
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,260
ones there is the baler we all have that

41
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,580
one friend who says they're always down

42
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,990
to do stuff and then they make plans

43
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,250
with you and at the very last second

44
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,960
they tell you that they can't go or they

45
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,430
bail hence the baler hey Greg do you

46
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,090

thing appointment conference the judger

51
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,930
just like it says in title this is the

52
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,520
friend that literally judges you for

53
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,259
everything that you do I see you in man

54
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,550

passive-aggressive friend this is one of

62
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,700
the most annoying types of friends in my

63
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,929
opinion they never ever tell you exactly

64
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,429
what they want to say or what they want

65
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:57,960
to do it just hint at it so that you

66
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,880
don't believe the bad guy and they put

67
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,280
it on you all right so who's driving I

68
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,009
can't because my car's in the shop so I

69
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,360
can I can I I did drink a little so I

70
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,039
mean like if you don't mind riding a

71
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,750
little drunk it's fine oh I do have shoe

72
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,829
boxes in the back that's kind of taking

73
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,000
up some space so they'd probably be

74
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,410
really uncomfortable for three people

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
but it's cool cuz I can just throw my

76
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,380
shoes on in the trash I'll need them I

77
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,000
mean I don't need shoes I cannot have

78
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,380
this as lepers even though it's really

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
not safe for my workplace you know as

80
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,870
long as you just don't block my rearview

81
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,769
mirror because you know I can't see at

82
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,090
night and I can't drive

83
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,459
oh it's Dave I can't see during the day

84
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,079
very well okay fine I'll try to I can

85
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,180
drive no it's it's fine I mean I can

86
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:31,950
drive as long as you drive okay let's

87
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,380
just go sure if that's what you want to

88
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,970
do the liger again another common one I

89
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,500
mean these friends pretty much speak a

90
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,030
different language when it comes to time

91
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,620
just have to translate it for example

92
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,970
Eiger says that they're leaving soon it

93
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,019
means they haven't even started to get

94
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,090
rid of it when they see they're on my

95
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,709
way that means I'm on my way to get

96
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,180
ready but I'm still 30 minutes from

97
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,680
leaving when they say I'm here that

98
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,209
means they're 5 to 10 minutes away and

99
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,620
then when the liger says I can't seem to

100
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,239
find you where are you that means they

101
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,739
literally just showed up at that second

102
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,480
the overly sensitive friend this is the

103
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,160
friend that takes every little thing so

104
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,180
personally that you get to the point

105
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,799
where you have to be careful what you

106
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,820
say around them and what you do around

107
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:07,620
them because you don't wanna offend them

108
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:10,260
oh wow what eft ITF TI thanks for the

109
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,400

116
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,319
unoriginal I didn't say that are you

117
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,000
calling me a lot okay it's not a big

118
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,829
deal we'll just drive back to the same

119
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,870
Greek food place at the same exact meal

120
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,400
so you don't feel left out okay no I'm

121
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,090
good what what else do you want just

122
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,069
don't want to go why Artie the ditcher

123
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,900
when a hot girl or a guy comes along

124
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:38,670
this is the friend that just changes

125
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,720
after them they disappear and completely

126
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:51,299
seem to forget about you and your

127
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:52,650
friends the photographer I guess this

128
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,060
one isn't really annoying to a lot of

129
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,409
you guys but this is really annoying to

130
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,790
me this is the person that has to take a

131
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,049
picture of every single little thing

132
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,730
that you and your friends do to them

133
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,000
they needs to be broadcasted or it

134
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,000
didn't happen

135
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,290
the chief friend this is the one friend

136
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,100
in the group that never pays for

137
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:23,480
anything okay I'll be right back I got a

138
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,720
all right and your friend over there

139
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,160
said you guys are paying together

140
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,390
he overly competitive friend this is the

141
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,530
friend you never want to play games with

142
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,280
because they always get way too

143
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,790
competitive

144
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,650
oh that's that's a scratch right there

145
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,270
you just hit it just hit the ball like

146
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,470
are you serious no it's cool I mean like

147
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,510
if you want a handicap again get out

148
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,520
take it easy man it's cool it's your

149
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,900
turn go ahead just go ahead you need the

150
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,790
help so I hope you need to play by the

151
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,370
rules even by your rule but your dumb

152
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,810
ass was fine the check out this video

153
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,220
friend I need a better title for though

154
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,420
this is the one friend that always wants

155
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,130
to show you a video that he or she

156
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,320
thinks is so funny or cool or awesome

157
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:00,020
even though they're not that funny or

158
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:05,000
cool or awesome you see that twist so

159
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,740
good right right right right the over

160
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,240
the honest friend and last but not least

161
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,440
you never want a lying friend that's

162
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,150
like one of the top things you don't

163
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,070
want in a friend sometimes the overly

164
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,380
honest friend can actually be a lot more

165
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:20,060
annoying for example see that twist so

166
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,700
good right right right right this video

167
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,680
sucked oh because sometimes it's better

168
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,960
to lie to a friend than to actually hurt

169
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,120
them this video sucked oh but I guess

170
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,850
there's a good ending to it and it

171
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,200
doesn't end awkwardly and again I didn't

172
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,700
make this video to call friends of mine

173
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,900
nor do I think you should send this to

174
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,580
your annoying friends because that'll

175
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,050
probably result in you know you having

176
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,220
less friends it's actually the opposite

177
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,020
when I made this list I actually

178
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,250
realized that I do a lot of these

179
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,810
annoying trees I mean when you watch

180
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,010
this video I'm sure you guys pinpoint in

181
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,970
which one of your friends is this and

182
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,229
which one of your friends is that but

183
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,610
sometimes we forget to look at ourselves

184
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,810
you haven't already you should rewatch

185
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,220
this video and instead of thinking about

186
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,990
all your different friends that these

187
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,160
apply to think about yourselves if

188
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,840
there's something a friend does that

189
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,010
really annoys you chances are you do

190
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,450
something that really annoys that friend

191
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,130
as well because there's no such thing as

192
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,780
a perfect friend which also means that

193
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,400
you're not the perfect friend either in

194
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,840
order to preserve that friendship we

195
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,520
have to learn to just accept these

196
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,440
annoying traits and realize that no

197
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,630
friend yeah how would you know you have

198
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,890
no friends I have friends okay just

199
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,389
because I'm talking to an annoying

200
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,159
imaginary one it doesn't

201
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:21,050
I'm not imaginary what you still don't

202
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,879
get it get what you see how annoying I

203
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,259
am - yes you are incredibly annoying

204
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,819
it's just why you named me annoying

205
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,169
wrong I didn't call you that you called

206
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:36,889
yourself that exactly

207
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:44,750
I called myself that and I am you gonna

208
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:49,430
knowing all along you see that twist so

209
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:54,560
good right right right right this video

210
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:56,539
sucked oh but I guess there's a good

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:08,750
ending to it and there's an end

212
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:10,900
awkwardly that's really bad for you

213
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,900
right

today we're taking it to the next thing

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,710
little a little hair right there it's

13
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,570
kind of terrifying yeah like a little

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,219
spring coming off his head so if you

15
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,989
guys don't know Devin is literally my

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,520
best friend in the entire world and this

17
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,960
right here is my other Phil the best

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,280
friend we're gonna be on a head-to-head

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
and we're doing this sibling test so our

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,399
dad has prepared a list of questions

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,050
that we should know about each other and

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,760
who basically our dad's gonna ask a

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,050
question like what color eye Devon's

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,730
eyes something better than that

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,199
hopefully but it was on the top of the

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,579
dome bro and then I'm and he's gonna

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,750
write down what color he thinks his eyes

28
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,820
are I'm gonna write down what color I

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,440
think his eyes are we're gonna trick

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,510
reveal and if we get it right

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,250
then nothing happens it'll be a lot

32
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,740
harder than that no my trust me it will

33
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,479
but let's say I get it wrong and I say

34
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,189
that his eyes are red I don't know why I

35
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,700
would say that then the other person

36
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,409
gets to paint that is it on the losers

37
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,880

82
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,660
not it's not no no but it's like it's

83
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,760
like a cloud with too much excess that's

84
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,480
no way to describe it yeah it's just not

85
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,280

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:31,980
what oh I know this one 3 2 1

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,870
always having to be right yeah which I

91
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,120
have to say is you know you got a lot

92
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,390

96
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,140
Devin is argued this whole point for him

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,630
to be bright I smallest

98
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,300
same thing he still argued about being

99
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,270

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
hey you guys how's it going it's Justine

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,970
and today we are doing a what's on my

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,830
iPhone 10 video these videos are always

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,660
so highly requested and so crazy because

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,280
a lot of the times I start completely

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,559
fresh when I get a new phone and the

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,030
iPhone 10 is no exception I also started

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,379
fresh from I got the iPhone 8 and I

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,210
thought for sure that I was gonna just

10
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,830
port everything over to the new ones and

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,630
I decided no I'm gonna start fresh on my

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,460
iPhone 10 let's do this

13
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,960
and it usually takes me a good two weeks

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,699
which it's been a little bit over two

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,710
weeks now that have had the iPhone 10 to

16
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,090
really get back into the flow figure out

17
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,769
what apps I need and you definitely

18
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,630
figure out very very quickly what apps

19
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,520
you cannot live without when you don't

20
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,399
have any apps at all so starting on my

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,110
first page these are not quite in any

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,850
particular order like I used to have

23
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,590
let's see pays to have this over here I

24
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,300
like to have my maps I don't really use

25
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,800
my phone that often but I'll put that

26
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,510
one back over there so things aren't

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
exactly the way that I used to have them

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,260
but this is sort of my work in progress

29
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,539
this is what I cannot live without

30
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,520
basically I should title it back what

31
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,949
apps can I not live without No clickbait

32
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,329
hello only clickbait if it's not true to

33
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,670
starting off here from the top I've got

34
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,920
my calendar I've got my Apple maps and

35
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,299
Google Maps and I tend to only use Apple

36
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,590
maps when I'm in the car and I have it

37
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,299
connected to car play because it

38
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,799
integrates very well with my car then if

39
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,210
I'm wearing my watch it alerts me when I

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,650
need to turn so a lot of times they'll

41
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,540
opt to use that when I'm driving as

42
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,159
opposed to Google Maps but I do feel

43
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,360
like if I need to get somewhere and I

44
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,700
want to make sure that there's a traffic

45
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,100
or this or that I do feel like Google is

46
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,409
much more reliable still to this day but

47
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,950
Apple Maps integrates with my car and my

48
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,170
body so it's it's a tough choice anyway

49
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,030
moving on o'clock we've got the phone

50
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,950
we've got the Notes app which I use a

51
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,570
lot I use it for everything I use it for

52
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,880
making lists things that I need to buy

53
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,909
video ideas it's probably my number one

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,100
most used app next to messages next is

55
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,070
the App Store then Instagram Twitter

56
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,899
snapchat HQ trivia if you guys haven't

57
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,130
been playing HP trivia it is the most

58
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,290
fun game I've been talking about a

59
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,420
non-stop it's not sponsored this is just

60
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,430
honest-to-goodness excitement for a fun

61
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,259
game basically twice a day there is live

62
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,790
trivia you play you can win real money

63
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,280
if you'd like and you have it already

64
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,500
sign up using my little code right there

65
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,790
so that I can get some free lives yes I

66
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,049
need the lives then if you miss a

67
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,340
question it's almost like you didn't

68
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,989
actually miss it because they gave you a

69
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,390
life but you can only use one life per

70
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,180
game

71
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,220
ah the struggle I am so bad at trivia

72
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,380
it's unbelievable next up we have

73
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,360
Facebook and then Amazon and then Amazon

74
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,580
Prime now which allows you to get

75
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,950
deliveries almost within an hour or two

76
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,840
Apple TV remote YouTube and then YouTube

77
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,000
studio which is a studio app for

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,860
creators it basically lets you have more

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,310
features you can edit thumbnails you can

80
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:35,230
do stuff that creators need to to who

81
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,650
there's more in-depth analytics you get

82
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,350
the point

83
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,820

84
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,500
next to post mates and if I didn't have

85
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,880
Cole's mates I probably would be very

86
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,680
hungry all the time or I would have to

87
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,290
learn to cook and clearly we know how

88
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,600
cooking goes for me and down the bottom

89
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,250
I have kind of like my most used things

90
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,260
which no matter what page I'm on I like

91
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,959
to have them easily accessible I've got

92
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,840
my messages my email which clearly I

93
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,850
need to check that Safari and my camera

94
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,290
handle the next page we have well it

95
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,020
says it's weather but this is basically

96
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,910
I need to change that actually let's

97
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,010
change that too I'm gonna rename it to

98
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,970
stuff this is basically all of the Apple

99
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,769
stuff that I didn't really wanna

100
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,410
necessarily delete but I don't really

101
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,959
ever look at weather news stocks

music and TV no I do use a lot of these

110
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,670
apps but a lot of times when I'm looking

111
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,989
for something I just kind of swipe down

112
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,330
and search for it so if I'm looking for

113
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,010
pages I don't really want to have it on

114
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,780
my home screen but I can find it easily

115
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,970
by going into the folder or searching

116
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,780
coinbase if you guys are a bit coin or

117
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,610
aetherium or virtual currency who

118
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,120
purchasers owners that's probably my

119
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:01,600
favorite cube this looks like a very fun

120
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,580
game but it's more a game of life it's a

121
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,470
period tracker sorry guys

122
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,390

Messenger I clearly don't really use

125
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:16,250
that very often because I could

126
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,800
messages uber venmo Sonos Dropbox the

127
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,450

128
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,970

watch and my phone PayPal

132
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,470
Spotify clips I love the new clips act

133
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,180
like you can push yourself and it's kind

134
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:36,650
of struggling because it uses depth to

135
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,120
sense to remove the background and since

136
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,530
I'm pretty close to this wall actually

137
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,870
it's doing pretty good job let's see

138
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,810
what else we've got metropolis we've got

139
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,190
this riverfront this is my favorite it's

140
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,950
the Millennium Falcon so you can like

141
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:53,810
look around and see stuff that's around

142
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,870
you Oh a mega destroyer what we look at

143
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:01,910

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,930
really cool new clips update is pretty

146
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,700
great I just wished that they would make

147
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,020
it so that you can film vertical instead

148
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,130
of making everything square because that

149
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,810
really messes up when I'm gonna save

150
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,850
things to Instagram and like I can't put

151
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,700
this in my story it's a square what are

152
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,650
you thinking tumblr saucy if guys don't

know what saucy is you guys may not be

154
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,160
old enough but it is an alcohol delivery

155
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,990
service so yeah it's kind of like post

156
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,730
mates but for alcohol and last but not

157
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,170
least I have my games folder I haven't

158
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,240
really downloaded many games with teaser

159
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,640
basically my go choose I never made a

160
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,410
video a long time ago making this cake

161
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,780
from cookie Jam but I'm currently

162
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,370
working on something else very fun also

163
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,170
from that game so spoiler alert Jedi

164
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,340
challenges I did in a box scene with my

165
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,750
friend Alex if you want to watch that

166
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,330
video I'll put a link in the description

167
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,400
and an annotation somewhere here it's

168
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,740
kind of like a really insane AR game

169
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,150
where you can be a Jedi and you just use

170
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,280
your phone you put it into the headset

171
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,570
you have a lightsaber and man it's just

172
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,700
the best

173
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,200
next I have goat simulator which I just

174
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,700
started playing I kind of want to do

175
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,710
some gameplay of it so I stopped playing

176
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,890
so that I can sort of go through and you

177
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,540
guys can see my actual genuine

178
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,520
excitement and surprise from playing it

179
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,280
because I opened it up I was like what

180
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,450
is this this is the best thing that I've

181
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
ever seen in my entire life

182
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,320
I also have best fiends and best fiends

183
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,030
forever because obviously another game

184
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,770
that I'm obsessed with this is the

185
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,080
destiny to companion app so if you guys

186
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,670
play destiny at all that's something

187
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,200
that you can use to alert your clan

188
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,970
that you're gonna be going and getting

189
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,130
ready for the raid I still haven't

190
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,500
raided yet I just really need to take

191
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,510
like a week off from real life and just

192
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,850
sit and play destiny prestige and call

193
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,290
of duty and finish Mario Odyssey I think

194
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,990
that'll probably be what I do during

195
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,610
Thanksgiving and Christmas so maybe then

196
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,020
I can catch up on games well I guess

197
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,190
that's it let me know if you guys think

198
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,200
that there's any other apps that I'm

199
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,940
missing I did have a few AR apps there

200
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,010
was it was that Dragon app it's like

201
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,020
this little dragon friend but I didn't

202
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,370
download it on my new phone yet there's

203
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,600
a bunch of other AR apps that I do want

204
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,460
to check out I know I keep talking about

205
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,810
wanting to try AR a if you have any

208
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,730

that I'm missing I feel like there's so

213
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,020
many apps that I can just get lost in

214
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,910
the App Store downloading and buying

215
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,160

223
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,150

"
353,Period 101 | Brooklyn and Bailey,GUG1P5c8Tmk,"Y'all have been requesting a Period 101 video for the longest time, so we did our best to answer the most common period-related questions that you've been asking for!

EVERY woman has a period, has THAT time of month where they go into their menstrual cycle.  While no one would describe it as an absolute joy, there are certainly ways to make it a little less dreadful!  Knowing and understanding how to use the must-have products, such as pads (and the different types of pads), tampons and other products, makes a massive difference.

Hopefully there is some period advice in here that is helpful to you, and make sure to ask your doctor, mom, sister, or anyone close to you in your life when making important decisions around your period.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,570
stabile let's go okay so the first

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,880
pumping point that we have what do you

21
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,310
use when you're on your period

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,100
tampons and pads and maxi pads and we

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,899
use it and so we've heard like regulars

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,450
and what's the difference and which one

25
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,070
I use and for most of you younger girls

26
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,719
and beginners watching your period

27
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,570
you're probably going to be using pads

28
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,799
because most the time you're young and

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,960
you don't know how to use a tampon

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,939
and all that so and maybe you're older

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,009
to use pads who knows I have three types

32
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,630
of pads here there are plenty of others

33
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,969
but we've you don't have a remain one

34
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,939
that's a maxi pad which is for people

35
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:46,670
who offer heavier flow and they need to

36
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,049
go like eight hours or so without you

37
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,689
know going to the bathroom and they need

38
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,310
to have extra protection that is what

39
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,329
this is and I will show you guys kind of

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,119
what it looks like on the inside

41
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:58,100
it is often compared to a diapers it

42
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,899
doesn't show it like a diaper does but

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,119
anyways this is what it looks like it's

44
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,310
for heavier flows and extra protection

45
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,579
if you need to ask and then I have a

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,039
spinner past year and it has wings these

47
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,200
little sticky wings here that wrap

48
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,120
around your underwear and then it gives

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,150
you like more of a secure you know

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,980
protection and

51
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,860
it may be thinner but it also captures a

52
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,260
lot so bad I have it's a really thin pod

53
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,629
that just lays right in your underwear

54
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,040
and it's like a panty liner too much and

55
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,049
it's got the feel of a really light flow

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,209
and you're going like you know a couple

57
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,650
hours or an hour or so and you're just

58
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:34,510
chilling at your house and if you want

59
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,069
to throw when it is on for comfort oh do

60
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:39,489
you I don't really like 12 then no one

61
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:41,590
works for you two and then hey boy you

62
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,480
can forget about these lovely babies so

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,280
similar to pads there's different sizes

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,319
of tampons and I'm not sure about all

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,190
the sizes are I like some sort of small

66
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,480
with small regular super-super plus

67
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,760
ultra

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,099
and then maybe Oh like this one is a

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,470
little bit smaller it's irregular so

70
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,569
this is the normal like receipt how long

71
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,459
this ticket it worse is this one this

72
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,019
one's basically just smaller so they can

73
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,340
fit in like smaller purses or when

74
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,379
you're traveling or if you just want a

75
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,840
smaller lunch in general but it is also

76
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:15,670
a small table and so it's a regular wear

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,310
if you have a heavier flow it bends a

78
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,079
super or super plug or somewhere around

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,180
that size will probably work better for

80
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,530
you all women are different so your body

81
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,940
sizes are going to be different your

82
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,069
period folds are going to be different

83
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,329
so these tampon sizes are just you kind

84
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,250
of have to experiment figure out what

85
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,949
works best for your body now ladies I

86
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,930
know less beginners it's really scary

87
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,549
I'm going to get ours usually use pads

88
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,079
and some women choose these ties to the

89
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,879
rest of your life which is totally cool

90
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,099
but if you're when I will be intercept

91
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,930
wants to try using cable and go for it

92
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,370
go for it that's all I have to say is go

93
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,989
for it I was one of those ones that was

94
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,579
like terrified to do it but then I was

95
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,829
like okay but I really want to try pants

96
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,590
on if you really like need some support

97
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,479
like asked a friend a sister a mom don't

98
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,849
I mean like all girls and always how she

99
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,169
is able to nail power you say real hell

100
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,479
and if you don't have a female like

101
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,819
close female nearby then there are

102
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,440
little instructions inside your on the

103
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,810
amp on boxes that give you step-by-step

104
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,220
on how you to apply Campbell and you

105
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,840
know if you're not sure you can go with

106
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,459
that and if you don't know which one you

107
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,919
would prefer using think about it this

108
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,109
way if you're active if you like to swim

109
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,789
if you're moving around a lot a pain

110
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,680
point must be more comfortable for you

111
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:23,080
to be wearing and the other perfection

112
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,919
you don't feel it as much but if you

113
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,930
just like

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,759
kill or you're hanging out your house or

115
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,699
things like that or if you just like

116
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,319
with your periods why my body's then

117
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,580
maybe a pad is the way to go for you it

118
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,810
totally depends on you

119
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,430
these are just a couple of things that

120
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,499
you guys can use when you're in series

121
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,990
okay so the next point we're gonna be

122
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:42,580
talking about is basically all of the

123
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,340
above and what you experience when

124
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,550
you're all in your period like grants

125
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:52,270
cravings and moves so the first project

126
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,110
is going to be remove it is so normal to

127
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,990
get Rudy and Italy remaining here and

128
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,689
the staff yeah because that is like your

129
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,250
body is so many hormones going like

130
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,180
going crazy and your body when you're on

131
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:10,960
your period it's like ah your emotions

132
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,969
to start like I actually most girls find

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,310
it they're like have one consistent

134
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,479
emotion it even works when you first

135
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,000
start your period like you're much of

136
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,250
the like wow I'm gonna how you know that

137
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,020
it's like and then I'm I made like it

138
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,659
starts going like this and then you just

139
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,180
have like the occasional bad meet words

140
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:31,330
like oh my god says that or something so

141
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:34,719
for me personally irritation and sadness

142
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,599
like ready to cry no no it's not time if

143
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:41,500
you can get irritation she cries I cry

144
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:49,419
like you drop you drop a feather on

145
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:51,879
earth it's like okay then I do you know

146
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:52,870
so yeah you cook a lot to be with and if

147
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,569
you feel sadness

148
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,849
you can feel anger irritated how

149
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,789
important for you to to recognize these

150
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,139
emotions on your own also because a it

151
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:04,479
will kind of give you a hint if you're

152
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:06,520
PMSing so I need to write about to start

153
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,949
your period and it'll also help you to

154
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,830
know like if you're really angry for no

155
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:13,240
reason I got a lot why do you even get

156
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,580
out he went down a little bit I think

157
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,630
again like we said before when you first

158
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,400
start your period is harder to realize

159
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,200
things and later as you get more

160
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,690
comfortable with any period and be

161
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,250
mindful and your emotions you learn to

162
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,820
kind of figure out okay I'm overreacting

163
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,500
how because I'm hormonal and apparently

164
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,140
eating lots of vitamins and fruits and

165
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,480
vegetable like flatus lag help life

166
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,510
maintain your emotions a little bit more

167
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,120
with your halt formula how stabilized

168
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,220
mentalizing milk really help tell us if

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,870
it works if yeah let's try it let's try

170
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,820
together and see if it works I'm kind of

171
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:52,550
excited it's Reza's 99.999999 not not in

172
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,810
my segment I'll see you male crane food

173
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,380

174
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,810
going gravy

175
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,440
therefore you just decide that you know

176
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,640
what that tuna looks so good I need

177
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,130

what it is because we're tasting because

181
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,030
I think a lot of women crave sugary junk

182
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,280
food

183
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,730

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,790
healthier components to it and it's less

199
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,440
sweet so it's kind of more fulfilling I

200
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,750
feel like it's like router so you get

201
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,830
full back so when your body actually eat

202
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,630
something new to eat

203
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,640
your body wants more of it like that's

204
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,410
just a natural response well dark

205
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,090
chocolate it's a little bit less like a

206
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,430
little more bitter so when you eat it

207
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,380
your body naturally doesn't want a lot a

208
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,390
lot more of it so if you are saving

209
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,020
chocolate or something sweet

210
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,199
Starly be so good

211
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:28,379
with their toughen see how that was

212
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,509
throw with the dreaded cream yeah it's

213
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,610
not cramps it's back pain if it's not

214
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,469
back pain guy if you got a headache

215
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,169
you've got a stomachache if it's no

216
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,690
stomachache year who Bobby's doing date

217
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:40,800
but it's always smart if you know you're

218
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,979
about to start your period you've seen

219
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,720
some PMSing sign to take some medicine

220
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,270
before maybe Advil

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,459
so that when's the cramps and pain do

222
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,500
come your body prepared and you don't

223
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,410
have to experience those two hours of

224
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,000
dreaded pain when a medicine fails this

225
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,760
happens you know Sam I'm like punching

226
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,850
over as I walk because I like trying to

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,950
express raining up her it's totally

228
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,170
normal and it happens to almost everyone

229
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,390
so I have to imagine options for any of

230
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,329
you who are looking for options for your

231
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,550
cramps Center and Advil menstrual pain

232
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:17,160
with is like a little wiggle pill you

233
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,350
take with advil version where it just

234
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,520
builds a pain for your grant and make

235
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,050
sure you would like have your parents

236
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,579
permission before you just start taking

237
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,200
really I don't think I know if you're

238
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:27,270
talking about what works for you and

239
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,589
what works with them too but these are

240
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,000
some things that work for us this was

241
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,390
pampering and relieve headaches

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,760
backaches cramps fatigue and then you

243
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,290
have mighdal which is pretty much the

244
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,730
ductus New Zealand yeah because all of

245
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,060
these are just like options for your

246
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,920
period

247
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,020
uh-huh and another thing that helps with

248
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,390
Krantz back pain joint pain anything

249
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,550
like that is like SVT pad do you think

250
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,440
can't laugh as a store and explain or

251
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,839
heat it up and then like have an icon

252
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,700
it's a manner that you don't necessarily

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,649
have to buy it though you can use an old

254
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,240
stock and fill it up with rice and feed

255
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,250
it out now I'm not it's like regular

256
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,990
activities like it's two minutes it heat

257
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,880
it up and then quickly on like your

258
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,399
abdomen area that hurts from cramps in

259
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,070
your back to help annoyance or whatever

260
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,770
Elling and I mean it was totally help

261
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,740
yeah now this is one of the things when

262
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,170
I first saw a Syrian I had no idea what

263
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,730
to do so nervous what happens when

264
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,680
you're on your period at school you

265
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,200
start your period at school you're in

266
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,390
public I'm at school I always bring a

267
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,190
jacket with me a because usually my

268
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,970
school freezing and be because if I do

269
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,160
bleed through

270
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,290
I have something tire around my weight

271
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,450
and nobody would really like that

272
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,190
like a waste or where if it's a longer

273
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:37,380
sweater or something so that it just

274
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,270
covers up the area if you bless her at

275
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,070
school and can't do anything about it if

276
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,470
you don't have the products that you

277
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,450
need to use the nurse will always have a

278
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,520
plan or pads all you have to do is go in

279
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,950
there and out run for it make a report

280
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,750
let me call when I have feathers and it

281
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,420
for some reason your nurse doesn't I

282
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,310
guaranteed some girl in your grade does

283
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,620
don't be afraid to ask either because

284
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,960
everybody's been in that situation and

285
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,370
it's wrong with you I've never had a

286
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,740
discuss burger girl who said no

287
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,290
literally I walk up I'm like I don't

288
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,750
even know you but once again I'm sorry

289
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,430
oh you know my newer super like end

290
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,010
she's and our teachers are very

291
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,690
understanding and if they're not don't

292
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,420
be embarrassed to say look it's an

293
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,430
emergency I have to go and if they still

294
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,290
say no then just leave as you guys know

295
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,940
has a female you have the right to deal

296
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,800
with your own personal hygiene problem

297
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,140
and if they're not gonna let you do that

298
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,480
they can't really get message and so

299
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,060
then comes the question of but I'm on my

300
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,710
period school and public how do I pull

301
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,300
my pants on a pan out and put in my

302
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,830
pocket so I can go to the bathroom and

303
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,960
put it in you know what the way I feel a

304
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,860
question that I am where we all have an

305
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,480
answer to really no solution right so

306
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,180
personally what I do is I put my jacket

307
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,590
on and I reach in my bag and I just flip

308
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,210
it up my sleeve and then I'm like

309
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,710
folding my sleeves and I'm like oh can I

310
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,210
go to bathroom and they're like yeah and

311
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,010
then I can just go to bathroom nobody's

312
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,900
seen it I also have friends who will

313
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,180
flip a tape on in their boots or in

314
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,670
their sock we're up their pant leg if

315
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:06,180
that's needed I'm so great there's

316
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,500
ausmus it along this was so cool I never

317
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,120
thought about this if you don't have to

318
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,720
see people carrying water bottles around

319
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,220
school

320
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,630
take the tape blonde then it looks like

321
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,220
it was carrying the water around all day

322
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:20,280
and like you're going to go fill up your

323
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,430

ever since I was sort of my period

326
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,120
pretty much I had a little bag in my

327
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,559
backpack and I bring it everywhere as I

328
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,259
quote like my little like my little

329
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,759

333
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,749

an emergency and I don't have anything I

339

can just swap one of those on and I have

340
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:01,009
enough time to go get something else I

341
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,870
always think in a few different sizes of

342
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,370
tampons because sometimes you're heavier

343
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,689
sometimes your wire you never know what

344
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,819
you need and then I'm carrying around

345
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,220
just a little bit of Advil or ibuprofen

346
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:11,809
just know that I if I get cramps in the

347
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,970
middle of the day I have something I can

348
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,220

00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,510
so I thought the game franchises since

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,400
since the year 2000 when it's live came

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,740
out I was eight going on nine years old

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,360
and it was my very very first PC game

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,759
course back then it looked a bit more

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,559
like this but nevertheless it completely

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,570
captured my imagination I absolutely

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,130
loved playing it every day after school

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,170
but as soon as I was a little tiny

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,210
sprout before I discovered the world of

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,820
hair dye and depression I've always

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,240
thought to myself now let's be so much

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,580
easier if I was a sim so I decided 17

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,559
years later three main games in thousand

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,399
spin-offs later I would find out once

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,160
and for all

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,010
how easy it is to live like a sin for a

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,660
day spoiler alert it sucked

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,489
the first off for my experiment I had to

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,690
create a film version of me you have to

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,010
go and watch that over on my second

22
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,110
channel if you wish to then I have to

23
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,370
recreate this house I did this a long

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,989
time ago so my living room looks a

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,250
little bit different but I recreate my

26
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,379
entire house so and you know I never

27
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,730
have to do a house tour there it and

28
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,640
then the idea was that I was just going

29
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,559
to Punk the sins out of me in my sin

30
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,309
version of my house and just let her

31
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:09,950
live and free well for 24 hours no input

32
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:14,909
from me whatsoever seven 3731 since I -

33
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:17,729
I'm getting a lion uh-huh Oh 755 she

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,890
woke up not too bad

35
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,900
oh my soon as decided to become angry

36
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,820
today well I'm glad was staying

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,979
realistic so I made notes of every

38
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,780
single little thing that my sim did to

39
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,570
the minute I very quickly discovered

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,670
that the timings were very off oh my god

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,250
we're taking so long to eat I am a

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,770
really fast eater apparently is what I'm

43
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,350
learning because who the hell eats one

44
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,119
bowl of cereal for 19 minutes see just

45
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,640
the problem I'm having here with this

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,189
sin is I woke up at 7:55 a.m. it's now

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,670
midnight I'm going to be absolutely just

48
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,890
exhausted at this point go to bed to

49
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,649
noodles at 1:00 a.m.

50
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:05,969
nobody noodles at 1:00 a.m. that whom

51
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:08,160
457 457 she finally stopped playing

52
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,150
guitar oh yeah your time

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,280
you're hired at 5:05 we finally go to

54
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,670
bed this is going to be one hell of a

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,840
day

56
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,460
why should we have a seat for you no

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,670
that's not good because that's still

58
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:26,400
within the NA that's still within the 24

59
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:28,080
hours so I have to gather 649 now that I

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,650
get imported me to disclose that there

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,600
was a first attempt before there was the

62
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:47,940
final attempt we don't we don't talk

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:50,940
about the first attempt oh I couldn't

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,160
have planned this if I fucking tried

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,520
also note that the smoke alarm is doing

66
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,290
absolutely nothing so much shit this

67
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,720
let's start again tomorrow shall we so

68
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,000
eventually I had my list of tasks to do

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,120
for the 24 hours which I happen to still

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,120
have on my phone I had to wake up 755

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:20,130
755 and I have one minute before I have

72
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:27,780
to be up and making with it I think this

73
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:29,220
would make my bed 736 this look and hold

74
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,780
a minute okay

75
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,480
fuck oh I don't want to do stay no good

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,709
more than everybody I know why my voice

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,360
is so dead for sure why not today I live

78
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:47,459
like a sim Nick in the back this is been

79
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,370
complaining that I am more than aware

80
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,870
but this is what people do normally will

81
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,350
do this every morning someone these

82
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,989
people that has these stupid cushions on

83
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,640
the bed put on a bed and then when it

84
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,540
comes to going to bed just throw them

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,340
off and then it's just put back on the

86
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,100
morning it doesn't make any sense

87
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,020
why do we do this why does anyone do

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,760

to do it that way but it doesn't work in

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,860
the real world is what I'm climbing out

105
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:06,850

106
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:11,620

since 8 12 and my next thing is at 8:23

115
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:45,660

116
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:51,610
me a night a whole minute no certain I

117
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,720

kitchen for a video okay if this starts

192
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,160
setting fire well I like to be very

193
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,000
reminiscent at the first attempt it's

194
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:46,600
not one revolution on look bro oh fuck

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,240
what is the theory on fire hold on there

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,880
why is the fire why is the fire why is

197
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,170
it can you eat fire in my house I think

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,440
I might have left a sticker on the

199
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,089
bottom of the pan maybe all I am balloon

200
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,980
residue I think that might have been it

201
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:05,570
did use a new pan so those of you

202
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,520
wondering what it's like only being the

203
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:13,430
level one cooking skill it's that nice a

204
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,700
realistically timewise that wasn't so

205
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,360
bad

206
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,279
but I do have to eat just 15 14

207
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,459
after spending half an hour is an

208
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,709
amazing meal the horse is working and

209
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,259
I'm not making over all the successful

210
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:31,199
so I left I haven't have a drink if I

211
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,689
don't I will just die oh I should hope I

212
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:37,499
say I'm dirty again late day oh good I

213
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:38,850
get your PA a clock Oh oops oh joy I

214
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:42,720
will admit that after I finish my

215
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,429
scallops and bacon we we hit a new low

216
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,889
you know we were peeking and then we

217
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:49,709
trust we trust a lot here we hit our

218
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:53,639
first hurdle and that was sheer boredom

219
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:56,610
it's now 14:47 that's what five minutes

220
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:00,029
to eat and I have another for what 31

221
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,869
minutes unless I can't count so what do

222
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,860
I do now

223
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:06,059
I feel like we've hit a new low here

224
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,249
because I cannot just sit here doing

225
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:10,170
nothing my mind won't allow them to be

226
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,749
that Island for that long

227
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,449
and I will admit I had a momentary lapse

228
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,939
of judgment and use my boredom I did

229
00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:22,170
what I have always always resorted to

230
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:24,230
yes there's a little pocket you cannot

231
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,569
expect someone to sit there in silence

232
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,079
unless they really just love meditating

233
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:33,720
which I do not personally ah so you know

234
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,919
what I'm just I'm gonna play a tiny bit

235
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,660
of older not too much okay and then as

236
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,959
soon as the alarm goes off we'll get

237
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,499
back on track when when you slip up just

238
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,540
own it

239
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:47,639
well I mean with that word you can get

240
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,029
away with anything you know so that

241
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,139
maybe don't maybe don't just own it only

242
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:54,119
put up and then went back into the

243
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:58,919
kitchen just washing up and then the

244
00:11:54,119 --> 00:12:01,589
real fun began because it's 15 30 oh boy

245
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:04,110
I have to watch comedies until quarter

246
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:08,040
past eight that's five hours of Shrek

247
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,760
film and I did it so obvious reasons I

248
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,079
cannot build

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:17,199
and it's five hours of my life I don't

250
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,510
know what to do just trust me that given

251
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,329
the choice between working or watching

252
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,750
Shrek you've got nothing to worry about

253
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:28,329
I'm not going to lie to you okay trust

254
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,959
me on this short it was mean tastic you

255
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:37,149

256
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:42,279
you oh my goodness it is 1952 I've just

257
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:45,430

one a Finnish reckful I've completely

260
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,690
lost my mind now watching three Shrek

261
00:12:51,130 --> 00:13:00,820
films in a row was great but really my

262
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:02,139
numbing ah I pee it 20:22 so I have to

263
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:04,180
wait another half an hour now

264
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,699
what kind of watch for half an hour I'll

265
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,790
watch I reckon more episode they're sort

266
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:13,690
of fine it's not over yet always got pee

267
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:18,269

268
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:21,220
real struggle kick it's a 20:39

269
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:24,100
just done washing my hands for four

270
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,589
bloody minutes and now I'm just

271
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,760
restringing my guitar and then we shall

272
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:33,279
begin this evening of Hell now hands up

273
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,120
I did not manage to complete this I just

274
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,790
couldn't do it

275
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,690
I play guitar from like half eight until

276
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:43,660
one was it Oh 4:57 a.m. that's just like

277
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,329
eight hours of guitar playing I didn't

278
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,040
do it but I will say that this footage

279
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:52,060
that you're watching right now was sped

280
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:55,089
off by about 50,000 times literally all

281
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,430
my editor it says like 56,000 percent

282
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,940
faster I really did film for as long as

283
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,339
I could

284
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,290
it was out at this point though my main

285
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:05,410
camera battery died so I had to resort

286
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,810
to blogging and here are some you know

287
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,389
in the wilderness though vlogs for you

288
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:15,459
of my brain at one o'clock in the

289
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:18,490
morning suits now 22,000 and it's going

290
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,910
okay so far I don't feel tired my voice

291
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,500
is very tired but I'm doing okay I'm not

292
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,750
too bored as playing guitar

293
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,060
my fingers are aching a little bit put

294
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,000
that's okay we're going to go another

295
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,940
six and a half hours to go why did my

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,380
sim stay up until 5:00 a.m. I'm asking

297
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,640
myself that every five minutes now so

298
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:41,980
it's now exactly one o'clock in the

299
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,170
morning so I've got another four hours

300
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,270
to go um it's been going alright

301
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,920
actually it hasn't been as bad as I

302
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,890
thought it was going to be my fingers

303
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,470
are killing me now though and my battery

304
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,560
well both batteries I have for that

305
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:02,860
camera have both died so we're down to

306
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:07,180
this camera now I'm going to go to bed

307
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:12,940
now sorry sorry I couldn't stay up until

308
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:15,070
five oh five but 343 is definitely

309
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,810
relevant I feel like shit I'm gonna bet

310
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,090
fuck this fucking video fuck this

311
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,090
bullshit so I made it through to nearly

312
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,130
four o'clock okay I only had another

313
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,800
hours ago but I couldn't do it my body

314
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,380
was just refusing so I did go to bed

315
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,850
earlier but I did wake up when I was

316
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,589
told to welcome at 6:49 but but uh some

317
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,960
of you may know that I have a

318
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:40,510
pre-existing fatigue condition which

319
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,520
makes waking up in the morning pretty

320
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,670
much impossible this is like my favorite

321
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:48,460
bit of the whole thing I woke up spawns

322
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:51,790
the camera and then literally just fell

323
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,339
asleep in this corpse position first a

324
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:59,170
long one off and uh I think I'm ready

325
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:03,550
for death I'm getting ready to death now

326
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,860
he is 651 and I have to stay awake into

327
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:09,370
10 power 7 I don't really see Evan and

328
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,430
maybe we'll probably move I just I just

329
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,980
died that was it I was gone I did wake

330
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,960
up again uh in like 2 minutes but then I

331
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,760
fell back asleep again my body cannot

332
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,920
handle like two three hours of sleep

333
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:26,140
I'll just die oh my god if I don't just

334
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,920
put my feet on the floor it'll just look

335
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,990
sleep so why am i running a bar I mean I

336
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,589
do really smell because I didn't have a

337
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,120
shower yesterday thank you same MO seven

338
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:38,890

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,210
staying awake I wish time I might

340
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,000
actually be awake and then what you have

341
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:45,190
to get back to sleep great but then it

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,930
was finally time to wake up for the

343
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:53,410
final time and run myself a bar

344
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:56,410
7:46 so I'm going to take that bubble

345
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,620
bar let's go run above and then 755

346
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:04,510
we've hit the 24 hours and simple all

347
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:10,689
right Judas and three four hours of

348
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:15,240
stairs so and then like same time around

349
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:15,240
I don't understand why Mohsen chose to

350
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:21,370
look at them every no one SM chose to

351
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:23,339
watch Shrek's and five hours plays off a

352
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:27,309
hours and sleep for three hours

353
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,230
that spell stupid yes oh and sports for

354
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:31,090
four hours standing up but it also sure

355
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,780
if you need to ascend to their own

356
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,940
devices they do nothing all day and then

357
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,880
try and damage their body clocks

358
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:43,870
apparently commercial racing woke up at

359
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,660
7:00 or is it sensory what's in b9 Tyler

360
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,920
because she smells her back I've never

361
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,559
woken up from my own stench before so

362
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,380
definitely a smaller Adonis um it was

363
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:59,290
good kind of it was interesting I will

364
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,600
leave it to you Fujiyama to wrap things

365
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:04,270
up a little bit because I did it I

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,030
actually did it I managed to live like a

367
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,130
sin and here are a few points I wish to

368
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,350
reflect on the one minute every second

369
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,300
thing I understand that Sims have to do

370
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,160
it but it sucked

371
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,230
no human takes 12 minutes to walk down

372
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,059
the said something's really made sense

373
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,950
like the cooking time they actually

374
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:22,960
worked out really well the evening times

375
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,270
not so much for the actual cooking time

376
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,030
none of my foods like screwed up that

377
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,429
badly parts of meeting scientist none of

378
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:32,740
the food went rock the washing-up plans

379
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,480
were perfect one could argue the Shrek

380
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,730
times were perfect so the fact that the

381
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,950
Sims didn't shower the fact that she

382
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,020
woke up the next morning from her own

383
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,340
stench because she didn't just have it

384
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,740
in her routine to shower

385
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,750
I felt disgusting all day the sin didn't

386
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,809
brush her teeth the sims didn't

387
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,600
willingly drink water I have

388
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:55,559
drink water and wine with the sin stand

389
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,559
up for out please rapid ei in the future

390
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:02,070

391
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,799
survival hey patch it it okay patch that

392
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,169

time for the reason the kids are so

56
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,250
excited corn maze now I'm gonna admit

57
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,359
this is mostly for kids because I'm so

58
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,780
tall I can actually look over the whole

59
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,480
thing it gives a little taller it gets a

60
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,810
little tall in the back I'll be fine but

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,359
kids are gone right we're gonna left I

62
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,250
see what happens if we're lucky we'll

63
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,980
lose the kids in here oh we have a dead

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,569
end I kid in the right way apparently I

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,090
know I think in my lifetime done maybe

66
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,260
like three corn mazes

67
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,750
none of them been really like epic

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,419
though I hear that there's a few here in

69
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,639
Arizona around Halloween like the scary

70
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:12,680
farms like fear far manned like there's

71
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,120
one down like Mesa slash Gilbert if you

72
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,900
guys know of a really awesome awesome

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,039
corn maze like you can legit get lost in

74
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,410
let me know the comments down below

75
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,150
because I'm actually really tempted do

76
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,620
one then there's like those garden mazes

77
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,570
like I know England has a lot of them

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,280
over and over in like Europe there's a

79
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,289
bunch of like crazy like garden mazes

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,460
these are permanently there I don't

81
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,659
think there's any of those in Arizona

82
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:39,050
but it's really really cool we did lose

83
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:41,180
the kids ready there's much different

84
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,130
ways to go all right

85
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,130
I'm following you pretty lady

86
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:56,180
eventually oh you guys should totally

87
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:57,500
scared her how we do see you I'll bet

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,949
you guys are like trying to wait for her

89
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,949
to scare

90
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:15,070
oh geez all right well we got multiple

91
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:19,870
ways to go it's probably not just one

92
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:27,400
pack probably like you or like Ariel it

93
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:28,600
probably looked like something like

94
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,230
there's so many different ways to go I

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,230
don't know where to go

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,330
I'm guessing say it's right I feel like

97
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,860
we need to go this direction at the same

98
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,940
time I know the inch the exits that way

99
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,780
too so I'm not sure where were supposed

100
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,460
to go but I lost tipping the kids now

101
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,810

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,330
now like the kids and Tiffany are

129
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,830
actually going through the maze the

130
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,520
opposite direction and so we're gonna

131
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,450
run into each other at some point I

132
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,990
don't hear anything I don't see anything

133
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:42,630
I'm like legit oh wait oh not my sight

134
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,700
Tiffany it's somebody else though crap

135
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,540
now I'm like separated from them and

136
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,680
probably were probably going the

137
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,020
opposite directions so we're probably

138
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,050
around each other some point like we're

139
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:56,990
like hoping Tiffany's blogging otherwise

140
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,990
it's blogs me me lost in a corn maze

141
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,120
nope I saw you guys oh and by the way

142
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,910
for those of you who are wondering you

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,550
know why I didn't stream this cuz I was

144
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,610
gonna stream on Twitch Tiffany said

145
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,560
she'd go through me not because a it

146
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,780
takes away from me vlogging which I do

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,340
the majority of vlogging obviously fine

148
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,780
- it takes away from family time like

149
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm talking to chat I'm not talking to

150
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,530
her like kids so she's not a fan

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,600
actually as much as I love doing the

152
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,700
ayat real stuff and streaming we're out

153
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,010
and about doing things when it's the

154
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,760
focus of the vlog or when it's a family

155
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,650

Enjoy~!

00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:44,880
[Instrumental]

5
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,380
With a bold and sudden calling,

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,160
Western Revolution's starting.

7
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,100
Let our hearts be open to it,

8
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,760
Pacifist nation.

9
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,760
Riding on a penny-farthing,

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,400
It's the flag of our sun rising,

11
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,300
Warding evil spirits like an

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,220
I C B M

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,380
On the train tracks, running along the line,

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,380
Let us move forward, don't look behind.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,260
Boys and girls becoming like samurai,

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,980
Just like those from our previous life.

17
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,540
Thousands of cherry blossoms,

18
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,680
Dwindling in the light,

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,580
Though I can't hear your voice,

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,300
Keep what I say in mind.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,360
This bouquet that surrounds,

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,960
Is iron poison, see?

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,620
Looking down at us from that big guillotine.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,220
Darkness has just engulfed the universe we know,

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,880
The lament that you sing can't reach ears anymore.

26
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,880
We are still far away,

27
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,460
From reaching clear blue skies,

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,100
Go ahead, keep shooting,

29
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,820
With that ray gun, fight!

30
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:37,880
[Instrumental]

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,320
Veterans who've trained through struggles,

32
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,100
Are now officers in battle.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,840
Here and there, we see the harlots in procession.

34
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,560
This one, that one, doesn't matter.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,460
Every single person gathers,

36
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,280
March on to our saintly deaths, now,

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,980
1, 2, 3, 4.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,100
Passing through the gates on the mountain peaks,

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,980
Escaping this world, kill all the evil fiends.

40
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,220
Surely this will end in a denouement,

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,900
Among the crowds giving their applause.

42
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,520
Thousands of cherry blossoms,

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,600
Dwindling in the light,

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Though I can't hear your voice,

45
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,220
Keep what I say in mind.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,380
This bouquet that surrounds,

47
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,880
Is iron poison, see?

48
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,560
Looking down on us from that big guillotine.

49
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,960
Darkness has just engulfed the universe we know,

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,880
The lament that you sing can't reach ears anymore.

51
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,840
We are still far away,

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,380
From reaching peaks of hope,

53
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,960
Go ahead, keep shooting,

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,740
Use that flashing bolt!

55
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:20,040
[Instrumental]

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,240
On the train tracks, running along the line,

57
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,940
Let us move forward, don't look behind.

58
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,200
Boys and girls becoming like samurai,

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,840
Just like those from our previous life.

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,500
Thousands of cherry blossoms,

61
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,520
Dwindling in the light,

62
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,740
Though I can't hear your voice,

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,220
Keep what I say in mind.

64
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,480
That bouquet that surrounds,

65
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,780
Is iron poison, see?

66
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,500
Leaping down to us from that big guillotine.

67
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,160
Thousands of cherry blossoms,

68
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,140
Dwindling in the light,

69
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,320
Once your song can be heard,

70
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,780
We'll dance with all our might.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This bouquet that surrounds,

72
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,340
Is iron poison, see?

73
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,940
Go ahead, keep shooting,

74
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,800
With that ray gun, lead!

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:53,540
[Instrumental]

fan favorite song by Peter and starring

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,600
Pokemon characters the finger puppets

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,610
and miniature set gave us extra time to

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,829
spend on some other enormous projects

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:44,190

22
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,410
indie game with four themes that was our

introduction of Rambo a creepy cute

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,789
title the world was going nuts over one

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,140
cool song and costume later I was a

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,239
real-life Fran searching for her

27
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,590
sidekick Kitty mr. midnight what is the

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,590
name of the cat playing mr. midnight

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,010
he was brand new on the scene but mr.

30
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,810
midnight was played by mr. meows eNOS

31
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,729
fans rejoiced in February when an

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,159
unexpected resident eNOS sequel was

33
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:17,320
launched by Disney XD by maker mark

34
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,930
Dodger and their sparkly friend all

35
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,479
returned for more eerie musical nonsense

36
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,150
this time lost in a place called monster

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,220
Gulch not everything on page ended up on

38
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,020
screen however what character was

39
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,250
originally going to meet eNOS and his

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,250
friends in monster Gulch

41
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,430
if you guessed werewolf you're actually

42
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,259
wrong

43
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,330
the original script contained a goofy

44
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,810
witch who we decided to save for a

45
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,270
future

46
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,130
eNOS adventure Valentine's Day never

47
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,960
ends well on re and this year was no

48
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,550
different this time we focused on the

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,860
schoolgirl murder dating game

50
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,960
yandere simulator loveless certainly in

51
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,210
the air especially off set we're less

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,830
murderous romance began to bloom which

53
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,550
of these people to die began dating two

54
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,550
months afterwards

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,590
if you guessed in vote chan you're

56
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,330
correct when began dating me in April

57
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,560
and it's never asked for a single fanny

58
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:12,050
shot so far did you guys know samus is a

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,060
curl that's a comment we got four months

60
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:16,610
after releasing our ironic animated

61
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,320
musical samus the spaceman cowboy we

62
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,850
thought the sloppy art style and the

63
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,250
reverent lyrics would give away our

64
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,690
tongue-in-cheek intention but I guess

65
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,910
the joke went over a lot of heads

66
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,160
speaking of heads would jump to tale

67
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,160
character did samus hang on his wall

68
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,720
if you guessed toriel you're a monster

69
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,269
seriously who would do that the answer

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,790
is Tammy it's no secret we like Pokemon

71
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:44,040
so with the launch of Pokemon go we knew

72
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,620
it was time to pull out all the stops

73
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,540
Go Go Pokemon go featured the hapless

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,099
fishermen on a quest to secure something

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,620
cooler than Magikarp

76
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,900
but in the end he came up mostly empty

77
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,000
who is the only Pokemon the fisherman

78
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,630
managed to catch if you guess Clefairy

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,010
you guess ray poor fisherman April

80
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,959
Fool's is always fun and this year we

81
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,610
had the juiciest joke of all after being

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,010
stalled for months Nass night for

83
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,410
suddenly appeared April first but alas

84
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,090
it was a trap it wasn't a total loss

85
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,190
though as the sequence turned out to be

86
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:21,500
canon in the full snap super cut which

87
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,500
fanatical did purple guy not appear

88
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,630
april fools purple guy appears in all

89
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,270
these episodes but you already knew

90
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,370
didn't you an old joke got resurrected

91
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,050
when our friends scott built us an onyx

92
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,940
costumes under the condition we wrote

93
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:36,380
him an onyx song we noticed no one

94
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,720
bought the extended version of the song

95
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,920
which was kind of disappointing now we

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,500
know how you fell huh

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,500
what was the name of AJ's pet rocks me

98
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,830
if you guessed dr. love muffins

99
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,630
at a point to your score of all the

100
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,020
undertale characters the most mysterious

101
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,760
is the glitch phantom at WD gasser we

102
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,800
thought he deserved a dark song and a

103
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,020
cool set but determined to the end

104
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,290
turned out even better than we hoped

105
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,680
though it took us massive reshoots to do

106
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,750
it

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,430
the wingdings hologram spoiled on the

108
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,430
ending - which re series

109
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,949
determined encounters eventually

110
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,889
translated the wing-dings the spoiled

111
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:22,049
ending was for snap the musical on June

112
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,000
7th random encounter celebrated its 5th

113
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,949
birthday with a live chat but as every

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,750
encounter could predict things didn't go

115
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:29,190
according to plan a comment stream

116
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,229
interrupted the chat with news of our

117
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,760
first cat Mia kitty who was terminally

118
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,190
ill and needed to be put down it's

119
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,810
written the flippy encounter if very

120
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,030
unhappy birthday for random encounters

121
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,740
indeed we were thankful to have included

122
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,360
her in many videos over the years and

123
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,669
she still brings a smile to us whenever

124
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,690
we watch them which musical did Mia

125
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,690
Kitty first appearance

126
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:52,929
the correct answer is people of smash

127
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:54,580
bros because that was actually when they

128
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:56,169
were doing a musical and singing a song

129
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,270
instead of at a subscribed screen like

130
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,550
empower pong which aj will technically

131
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,679
say is the right answer thanks for the

132
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,490
memories big kitty quick favor for Darth

133
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:08,589
Vader will kill this kitty oh we knew

134
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,629

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,069
and marks channel these two little

139
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:19,300
videos rocked our viewership and

140
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:22,119
propelled us through our most successful

141
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,860
summer on record even with a major last

142
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:25,809
second script revision you guys made all

143
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,249
the chaos worth it whoo where the

144
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:30,869
animatronics going to go find in the

145
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:30,869
alternate snap night for script

146
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,100
if you guess Jack that's sleep

147
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,250
he's even further away the market the

148
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,440
correct answer is phone guy Pokemon go

149
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,060
continued to be popular so to celebrate

150
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,190
its success and a lot of annoying

151
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,050
glitches we revised our Pokemon go

152
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,479
musical to be a little more realistic

153
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,910
seriously I couldn't even logon for like

154
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,490
the first week funny now I can't seem to

155
00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:00,889
ever log off which Pokemon go team Raj

156
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:04,010
Gwen and die on the correct answer is

157
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:05,450
team mystic yeah or Kudo rule you may

158
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,070
have noticed someone new on the channel

159
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,120
this year but the truth is he's been

160
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,650
around since the beginning

161
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,900
Nathan Morse came back to join re

162
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,669
officially disjoint extending is nearly

163
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,979
15-year mistake of working with me on

164
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,990
terrible videos which of these games did

165
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,400
Nate and I make a feature-length parody

166
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,400
of before re existed

167
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,080
if you guessed prince of persia' you're

168
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,790
right though we made parody versions of

169
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,830
all these one long year of filming

170
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,630
finally came to an end of this August

171
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,260
when random encounters premiered naff

172
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:41,390
the musical on YouTube 15,000 fans from

173
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,280
all around the world joined together for

174
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,800
a special live screening unlike any

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,960
other in re history some of you still

176
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,510
begged for a sequel but most of the cast

177
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,190
have moved on since or didn't make it to

178
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,080
the end of the series which of these

179
00:06:52,190 --> 00:07:00,080
characters ultimately survived five

180
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:02,780
nights at freddys deceptive as it sounds

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,030
the survivor is spring Tramp who unlike

182
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,730
the others never appears to truly meet

183
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:10,280
his end though he did lose his head a

184
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,780
little a little more Pokemon never

185
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,070
killed anyone at least that's what we

186
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,740
hoped when we made team full of harmony

187
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,180
our latest Pokemon goes on this time we

188
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,340
focused on the newly revealed team

189
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,810
leaders and their bitter rivalry do you

190
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,710
know which other musical was filmed in

191
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,110
the same building Meowth that's right

192
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,880
beneath blood and tears was shot in the

193
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,950
same building Trinity Community Church

194
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,590
which is where AJ attends every Sunday

195
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,660
morning in a messy change of pace next

196
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,580
we headed outdoors with 12 watermelons

197
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,650
for a short skit promoting our replayed

198
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,840
series of dead space the video was meant

199
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,310
to test whether content on Ari could

200
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,530
direct more traffic to our Let's Plays

201
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,110
but fittingly most of you wouldn't bite

202
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:51,460
what upcoming musical was teased on the

203
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,460
book AJ is seen reading

204
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:58,550
AJ was reading the Ace Attorney manga so

205
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,800
the answer is Phoenix right years back

206
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,360
we asked encounters to pick any one game

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,190
they wanted to see made into a musical

208
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,110
most and one of the highest requested

209
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,580
titles was Professor Layton recording

210
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,590
proved a challenge though when none of

211
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,420
us could provide a poor verb / - singing

212
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,790
voice so it turned to our friend Ben

213
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,890
patten dapper old bean and actual Britt

214
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:19,540
to dub the character for us who makes a

215
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,540
surprise cameo at the end of the video

216
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,890
the correct answer is Phoenix Wright

217
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,510
though I think Ganondorf and Professor

218
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,780
Layton would be great friends

219
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,610
sadly 2016 was the year we finally opted

220
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,950
to pull the plug on our gaming channel

221
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,840
replayed analytics determined that too

222
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,970
few encounters showed interest in our

223
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,070
Let's Plays while there aren't any plans

224
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,260
to revive it right now the channel has

225
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,750
remained in quiet limbo for a possible

226
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,850
future return what was the final series

227
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,090
miss Byrd created the four replayed went

228
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,090
dark

229
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,310
if you guessed a mentality you're

230
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:56,199
correct and a real replate fan give

231
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,519
yourself a pat on the back before we

232
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:59,199
could ramp up work on Phoenix right

233
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,180
unnotice arrived in the mail telling us

234
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:03,370
it was time to leave moving out so soon

235
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,889
was both shocking and inconvenient but

236
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,139
we had no choice we did however have a

237
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,759
chance to make one last song a tribute

238
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,560
to our home for several years and the

239
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,089
sets and videos we'd made in it the

240
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,310
video was planned from his Birds channel

241
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,899
originally but she allowed Inari instead

242
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,569
given its importance to many encounters

243
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,090
while we're on the topic what is the

244
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:23,930
name of Miss Birds YouTube channel

245
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,480
[Music]

246
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,100
if you guessed sparrow rain that's the

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
right answer go subscribe when you have

248
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,780
a chance for Halloween I took the reins

249
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,060
and invented a new re series called the

250
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,770
shovel werewolf which mixed terrible

251
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,570
shovelware games and creative ways of

252
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,270
destroying them think angry video game

253
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,640
nerd but fuzzier despite a grand escape

254
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,710
in the season finale our hairy antihero

255
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,080
wound up back to the grind for a holiday

256
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,870
special on Christmas Eve no rest for the

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,640
weary what prop does Ivan smash in every

258
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,260
episode

259
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,630
[Music]

260
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,130
the answer is a bottle perhaps I even

261
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,620
should try drinking from cans instead

262
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,720
call us sellouts but we occasionally

263
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,670
take on paid projects to help support

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,710
the channel projects like best fiends

265
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,680
forever the exciting free app available

266
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:15,160
now for iOS and Android our musical

267
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,360
start cute cats and slugs well cat slugs

268
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,710
and cute girls friends with girlfriend

269
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,630
which of Ahri's youtube friends was

270
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:27,160
making his own best fiends video at the

271
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:29,500
same time see how that one was too easy

272
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,050
dancers markiplier yeah he loves his

273
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,090
legs we swore up and down that we'd

274
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,220
never make Morphin ass but the more we

275
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,560
saw sister location the more the boys

276
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,630
couldn't resist when a flood and tears

277
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
seemingly abandoned the past videos to

278
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,620
instead focus solely on baby the one

279
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,200
familiar face returned to bridge the gap

280
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:49,780
between prequel and predecessor why was

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,340
I not originally cast as baby

282
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,990
[Music]

283
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,910
dun-da-da-da without a doubt the answer

284
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,330
is seen though ripping down the finesse

285
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,710
that helped ease my hatred just a tad

286
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:04,140
with the launch of Pokemon Sun and Moon

287
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,570
AJ again donned his Pikachu onesie and

288
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,970
prepared for some alonein hijinks from

289
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,920
tropical plants to grass skirts our yard

290
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,140
became an ethnic nightmare of cultural

291
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,480
appropriation and mismatched stereotypes

292
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,480
and yet most of you only question how

293
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,210
and why red tore off his shirt hashtag

294
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,720
priorities can you guess why red tears

295
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:26,490
his shirt off

296
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,650
the reason red rips his shirt off is he

297
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,990
spilled something on it namely his root

298
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:33,810
beer right as we were about to film the

299
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,630
ukulele scene come on VIN fee seriously

300
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,340
I had always joked I wanted to play ting

301
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,830
go on the channel but I was put to the

302
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,080
test when they cast me in tango bells or

303
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,360
is that tingle cells whatever you want

304
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,130
to call it it was creepy and weird but

305
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,530
we still kind of liked it enough to

306
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,870
record kazoo otamatone and jaw harp

307
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:54,090
parts in the music what can I say except

308
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:58,220
you're welcome which other Zelda

309
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,220
character shows up to ruin tingles video

310
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,860
much as we'd like it to be seen

311
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,210
the answer is be Ganondorf we do have

312
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,070
one more video we'd like to mention

313
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,440
though it will be launching the first

314
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,120
week of 2017 and that's the winner of

315
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,710
the poll launched five years ago in

316
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,020
which we asked encounter is what game

317
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,090
they wanted a musical for most so here's

318
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,190
one last question which of these Ace

319
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:25,420
Attorney characters will appear in our

320
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,610
Phoenix Wright musical if you picked any

321
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,860
of these you're correct because they're

322
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,660
all appearing in the series so here's a

323
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,120
short peak at Phoenix Wright the musical

324
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,430
now keep ending up here they're gonna

325
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:43,180
name a wing after you that would be cool

326
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:47,290
a serious question did you murder my

327
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,940

ado get up with this video yeah yeah

32
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:32,000
don't judge me too rigid spinners are so

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,650
much fun to play with and apparently

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,110
they were actually originally made to

35
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,700
help kids with ADHD concentrate in class

36
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,310
to replace things like tapping your

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,630
hands on the table or spinning pens so

38
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,790
if you have trouble concentrating you

39
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,800
might want to try one of these the first

40
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,390
thing I like to do is actually customize

41
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,430
mine that way it will be so much more

42
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,620
personal and unique and you want mistake

43
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,420
it for someone else's there are so many

44
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,070
ways you can customize yours but for

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,110
something simple I just use some glitter

46
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,420
nail polish to paint on this beautiful

47
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,460
unicorn metallic Brigitte spinner and I

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,110
thought it looked so cool you can use

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,820
any color you like of course and

50
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,830
customize it to your liking a nail

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,110
polish is so easy to control and make

52
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,750
your own designs use you can even hide

53
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,760
scratches or marks to serve as a bonus

54
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,860
it's like giving a one-digit sitter a

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,740
new coat of peach so it looks brand new

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:28,390
Oh

57
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:32,960
[Music]

58
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,820
Jesus after long periods of youth your

59
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,590
fidget spinner will eventually get dirty

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,750
and will result in your vision spinner

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,150
not spinning as smoothly as it should as

62
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,800
the dirt clogged up the bearing so the

63
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,900
first thing you should do is regularly

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,910
clean out the dust and hair from the

65
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,500
center bearing of your spinner first you

66
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,360
need to pop off the covering caps on

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,580
both sides so you can see the actual

68
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,830
bearings and then pick out any obvious

69
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,170
stuff and then clean the rest using a

70
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,850
brush if you do this regularly you'll

71
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,280
get your frigid spinner spinning longer

72
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,720
and smoother you'll really notice a

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,320
difference

74
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:12,610
[Music]

75
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,500
if you want to give your fitter a more

76
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,090
thorough clean the best thing to do is

77
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,950
actually use a rubbing alcohol

78
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,210
first you need to pop off the covering

79
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,190
caps on both sides

80
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,050
lots of rubbing alcohol out into a small

81
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,850
bowl and just drop your Skinner into it

82
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,680
let it sit there for a few minutes and

83
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,420
then give it a bit of a scrub as well I

84
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,430
found this tiny little brush which is

85
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,410
really handy for this part is actually a

86
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,570
dental floss brush so grab it for your

87
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,520
grocery stores rubbing alcohol is

88
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,470
perfect because it dries on its own I

89
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,150
won't leave any rust on your spinner as

90
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,920
you can see there's quite a lot of dirt

91
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,200
in spinners even just one which is

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,300
literally brand new which I haven't even

93
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,160
used that much so imagine what your

94
00:03:46,300 --> 00:04:02,110
spinner could look like inside after you

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:04:03,730
use it for a while that's very nice the

96
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,230
next trick that I thought was super cool

97
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,600
is a hack that allows your vision

98
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,340
spinner to look like it's warping just

99
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,260
hold it up against the window and then

100
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,209
use a camera that shoots in any less

101
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,250
than 30 frames per second this is

102
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,500
actually most cameras including your

103
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,200
phone camera and the effect of the warp

104
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,930
is just very interesting it looks kind

105
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,250
of weird British also super cool you can

106
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,720
definitely show you this one to your

107
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,760
friends and I think they'll be pretty

108
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,350
impressed so get to it right away guys

109
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,340
before all the when you call and start

110
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:38,319
doing it

111
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:38,319
[Music]

112
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,940
this next pack will allow you to get

113
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,130
more momentum when you spin at your

114
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,780
frigid spinner you'll need a three extra

115
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,700
bearing which you can either get from a

116
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,710
seat board or another fidget spinner the

117
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,570
kind of rigid spinner shown here you can

118
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,460
actually slightly push these bearings on

119
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,800
the outside halfway out of their home

120
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,540
next take your extra bearings and insert

121
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,760
them in would be elderberry and you'll

122
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,440
snap in and basically double up on the

123
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,180
outside bearing which will increase

124
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,370
their weight a momentum when you spin it

125
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:16,930
pretty cool right

126
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:16,930
[Music]

127
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,490
if you're using a fidget spinner to

128
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,080
concentrate in class you definitely

129
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,630
don't want to be spinning really loudly

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,460
or quickly and this is sometimes happen

131
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,410
with cheap spinners or a super old

132
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,090
spinner so the best thing to do is

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,710
actually to open up the center lid of

134
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,949
your spinners and gently smear some

135
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,259
coconut oil wd-40 or any other door

136
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:40,699
hinge lubricant on the inside you'll

137
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,710
find that your frigate spinner is now

138
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:44,569
super quiet and won't disturb any of the

139
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,199
other kids or attract the attention of

140
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,919
your teacher

141
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
which we don't want

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:06:00,710
a super cool trick you can try is to

143
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:02,449
actually use a pen or pencil to turn

144
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,370
your frigate spinner into a spinning top

145
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,710
first you need to find something that

146
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,330
fits on the inside of the bearing for me

147
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,250
it was the tip of the pen and then

148
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,500
basically just give it a good spin and

149
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:27,440
open just like a spinning top so this is

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:29,449
super cold sometimes rigid spinners can

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,849
be a little bit hard to grip and for me

152
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,069
because I have such long nails and maybe

153
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,780
done by the way it's hard to actually

154
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,849
spin the spinner without hitting this

155
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,710
side so you can actually increase the

156
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,630
height of the center cap and improve the

157
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,969
grips by speaking a cute little button

158
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,979
the one I use here is a super-cute glass

159
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,289
button on the top just stick it on with

160
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,030
some hot glue and you're done and feel

161
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,710
free to think of other ideas like using

162
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,569
a coin and then using nail polish to

163
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,310
cover it up or things like that but

164
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,650
basically this made it so much easier

165
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,150
for me to hold and spin you can

166
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,100
customize it to whatever height is

167
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:08,350
perfect for you

168
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,350
[Music]

169
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,810
mmm they smell lovely did you know you

170
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,910
can DIY own frigate spitter that's right

171
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,990
all you need is some old paper berries

172
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,520
and some hot glue

173
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,590
first you need a caller bearings

174
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,030
arranged like this take the middle

175
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,220
bearing which will be seat fitting

176
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,690
bearing and take it apart you'll need to

177
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,759
give it a good clean in rubbing alcohol

178
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,740
to get all the grease out then

179
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:32,750
reassemble it and arrange the forbearing

180
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,430
like fit lots of spots where each

181
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,080
outside bearing connects the center

182
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,300
bearing and then use a small amount of

183
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,070
hot glue to glue them all in place next

184
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,750
I use some double-sided scotch tape and

185
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,400
very carefully stuck it around the

186
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,229
outside of the full bearing

187
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,940
once that was in place I use some

188
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:49,099
colored shoelaces and stuck that to the

189
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,199
outside of the scotch tape this is still

190
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,970
pretty unstable so you need to take your

191
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,979
glue gun and fill in all the holes and

192
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,930
the corners that are now open and that

193
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,570
will make your DIY fidget Center much

194
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:02,360
stronger lastly I added some glass

195
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,740
buttons on as a cap and that's it you

196
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,690
guys can probably make it look so much

197
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,370
nicer than mine I just thought it was so

198
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,470
awesome that I could make my own midget

199
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:19,830
spinner that I had to try it out myself

200
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:21,870
[Music]

201
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,610

[Music]

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,710
friends are brilliant I love my friends

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,360
I'm sure all of you guys love your

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,160
friends as well but I'm sure you'll all

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,570
agree there is something quite fun that

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,980
about winding up your mates now I'm one

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,269
of those people I like messing with my

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,949
friends it doesn't matter where I am I

9
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,420
could have been in school I could be

10
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,250
around their house I could be in a game

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,289
if I can do something that will slightly

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,880
frustrate them just enough for them to

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,769
be a little bit wound up then I will

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,180
happily do it because that brings me a

15
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,099
lot of enjoyment and my friends would do

16
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,210
exactly the same thing to me so in

17
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,949
today's video I'm going to be showing

18
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,450
you guys how to get the upper hand I'm

19
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,010
going to be showing you how to build 10

20
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,989
redstone contraptions that are

21
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,610
specifically designed to wind up all

22
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,410
your maze I think you should be good fun

23
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,059
so let's crack up so the design number

24
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,800
one way against you creating the

25
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,600
ultimate noise machine that you can

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,399
place inside their base as soon as they

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
log in they will be well aware of this

28
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,730
thing all you need to do is place a

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,399
block where the redstone torches are on

30
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,379
all four sides of it and then redstone

31
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,289
dust in the middle blocks up on either

32
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,879
end and that will create a fast pulsing

33
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,260
redstone clock so that is like the heart

34
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,329
of the build they're not we have to do

35
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,369
is place loud things around it what I'm

36
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,830
going to do is place doors in all of the

37
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,330
corners just like this very very noisy

38
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,280
indeed and we're going to place trap

39
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,619
doors on top of all of those as well so

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,509
straightaway we've got quite a loud

41
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,130
redstone contraption now we're going to

42
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,229
do is I'm going to chuck them no blocks

43
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,090
on either end like this and then

44
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,950
underneath those no block I'm actually

45
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,189
going to throw in at some gravel as well

46
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,960
and as you can probably hear well it's

47
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,159
an absolutely horrendous noise and you

48
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,750
want to throw in something even more

49
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,000
disgusting you can check in some

50
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,740
dispensers as well this one that is

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,150
known as the secret Chicken dispenser

52
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,829
and the idea behind it is that it will

53
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,270
gradually fill your friends base with

54
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,189
chickens but it will do it slow enough

55
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,450
to your friend to not really notice so

56
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,649
we'll come back into his house and maybe

57
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,450
they'll be like one or two chickens

58
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,280
there oh that's a little bit strange

59
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,509
you'll kill them off and then he'll come

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,829
back here in the next day and they'll be

61
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,240
like two or three and I'll be like well

62
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,130
this is very odd how are these getting

63
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,930
in and I'll basically mess with his mind

64
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,939
just a tiny bit so the way that we need

65
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,860
to build it is we need to create this

66
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,960
sort of system right here then we need

67
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,790
to place a dispenser facing downwards

68
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,950
which is filled to the brim up with X

69
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,210
just like that then running into the

70
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,399
side of that dispenser you just want to

71
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,080
place a hopper then a double chest once

72
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,819
again fill to the brim with eggs

73
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,379
redstone dust and then you're going to

74
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,740
need to grab yourself an observer block

75
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,990
which

76
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,100
doesn't mean you need to be in the 1.11

77
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,660
snapshots you want to chunk that in

78
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,000
right there then on top of it you want

79
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,620
to place in a day licensure know

80
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,120
whatever you're thinking mumbo there is

81
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,040
a big hole in the wall my friend is

82
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,150
going to notice that instantly well

83
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,560
first off you need to make sure that

84
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,180
your friend has a few paintings in his

85
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,980
base and then you need to make sure that

86
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,020
you build that behind where one of the

87
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,730
original paintings was located then you

88
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,800
place a fence gate right here you open

89
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,510
it up and then chuck in a painting just

90
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,310
like that and there we go that has

91
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,930
covered the entrance which means that

92
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,220
the chicken will be dispensed it will

93
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,140
stand there for a little while it'll

94
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,700
walk out from behind the painting your

95
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,150
friend won't be able to tell where it's

96
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,830
come from

97
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,050
now unfortunately this design right here

98
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,310
requires you have access to command

99
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,900
blocks which could be a lil bit

100
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,030
difficult and also could be considered

101
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,500
just a tiny bit cheaty but if you do

102
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,840
have that luxury you want a place to

103
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,760
come on down and put this command on the

104
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,960
inside now it's a very long command

105
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,610
okay so I'll put it down the description

106
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,680
so you can just copy and paste it in

107
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,370
they essentially means play sound

108
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,020
minecraft entity creeper primed now what

109
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,760
do you think that means it's the

110
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,230
sizzling noise the sizzle noise of the

111
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,270
creeper so when your friend that walks

112
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,800
over this pressure plate right here he's

113
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,320
going to assume that there is a creeper

114
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,660
right behind him this about to blow him

115
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,790
up he's gonna panic anywhere where was

116
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,200
that but actually it was just a command

117
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,300
block underneath the pressure plates

118
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,070
I think that's hilarious all of your

119
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,080
friends have bases and the chances are

120
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,640
those bases have doors now I'm probably

121
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,870
the door of choice is the iron door

122
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,580
because it can't be broken by a zombie

123
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,800
and as you can see when we walk over the

124
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,050
pressure plate that door opens up really

125
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,880
nice and simple one thing you can do to

126
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,740
this door though is you can lock it so

127
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,240
they won't open when at that pressure

128
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,160
plate activates now the way that we have

129
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,530
to do it is we place in a door like this

130
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,700
so it's currently in an open State and

131
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,620
when we walk over the pressure plate the

132
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,510
door actually closes now that in itself

133
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,830
is a bit of a frustrating thing then

134
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,930
what we have to do is go up to the top

135
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,580
and chuck in a lever or some form of

136
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,230
redstone power source and there we go

137
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,730
we've done it your friend will then walk

138
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,250
over the pressure plate expecting the

139
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,320
door to open but instead they will

140
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,330
faceplant it your friend has just gone

141
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,370
AFK overnight they are over at their

142
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,049
crazy efficient farms again loads up on

143
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,340
loads of items but that does mean that

144
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,530
they're currently logged into the server

145
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,960
but they aren't controlling it which

146
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,070
means that yes this is a prime time for

147
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,750
messing with them because all you have

148
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,310
to do is push them somewhere now one of

149
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,360
my personal favorite things to do is to

150
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,069
push them through in

151
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,139
nether take them over to the nether hub

152
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,400
and transport them to a completely

153
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,800
different base somewhere that they've

154
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,270
never really been before just miles upon

155
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,939
miles away from their original location

156
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,120
now the only thing I will say about this

157
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:45,120
prank is try not to kill them both in

158
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,919
the transportation and also wherever you

159
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,020
leave them because if you leave them in

160
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,810
a spot where they can die chances are

161
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,729
they will die at some point and then all

162
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,250
of their items will despawn now that's

163
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:58,229
less funny okay if the your friend logs

164
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,879
back in and they see that they're in a

165
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,189
completely crazy location that's quite

166
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,870
funny if they log back in and they see

167
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:04,650
that they've died and they've lost all

168
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,500
of the things that have worked

169
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,879
incredibly hard for well they're

170
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,949
probably not going to be chuckling too

171
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,300
much are they now the chances are if

172
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,340
your friend is a tallington redstone

173
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,659
they will have one of these in their

174
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,860
base this is a very simple to bow to

175
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:18,870
piston door we stay on the pressure

176
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,340
plate and the doors open up and we stand

177
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,990
off the pressure place the doors that

178
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,849
close out behind us it's really very

179
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,770
nice and easy as I say if your friend

180
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,939
likes redstone they will have one of

181
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,520
these you just have to go out looking

182
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,870
for it now to do our next door prank

183
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,339
we're actually going to have to do some

184
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,050
slight modifications to this design

185
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,430
we're going to break all of this stuff

186
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,139
right here in fact we're going to get

187
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,870
rid of the pistons as well so replace

188
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,270
those blocks and just remove yeah all of

189
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,219
this redstone can go and well these

190
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,289
pistons can go as well and this redstone

191
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,789
and this block so as you can see we

192
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,990
haven't been left with too much and make

193
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:51,300
sure that you pick up all of that

194
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,469
redstone and chuck it inside a chest so

195
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,909
that your friend doesn't feel like

196
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,529
you're stealing all of their resources

197
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,969
anyway the next thing you want to do is

198
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,039
take out these two blocks right here and

199
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,990
place two blocks going across the bottom

200
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,759
just like this place some redstone dust

201
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,949
on the top and then it blocked up like

202
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,270
this a redstone torch right there and do

203
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,680
the same thing on the other side so

204
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,629
block up like that and a redstone torch

205
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,430
right there then next that redstone

206
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,500
torch you want to place in a sticky

207
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,210
piston facing across which is going to

208
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,189
be running into these blocks and do the

209
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,740
same thing on the other side just like

210
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,529
that so now what we've got is we've got

211
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,629
the regular 2x2 piston door there it is

212
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,120
this is what it would look like and then

213
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,949
in front of the 2x2 piston door we've

214
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,110
got the pressure plate everything looks

215
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,539
completely normal but underneath those

216
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,639
pressure plates we've got a lot of

217
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:38,250
cobwebs okay we've got a lot of cobwebs

218
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,169
place in as many as you possibly can

219
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,710
take it all the way down to bedrock if

220
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:42,870
you really want

221
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,400
- asking to take a very long time to

222
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,690
travel through and that means that when

223
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,830
your friend walks up to their base they

224
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,160
want to go through their little piston

225
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,970
door well yeah that happens you can see

226
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,039
we are now on a very very painfully slow

227
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,780
descent right the way down to the floor

228
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,520
for this one you're going to want to

229
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,050
enjoy breeding animals because we are

230
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,570
about to fill your friends base with

231
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:05,190
animals in a very creative fashion so

232
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,570
what you want to do is chug a steepest

233
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,970
and down than a slime block on top a

234
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,520
movable objects go around it a bit like

235
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,860
this now you can use obsidian you can

236
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,630
use furnaces dispensers noteblocks

237
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,460
chests as long as it can't be moved by

238
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,080
Pistons then it should be good for the

239
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,270
build then you want to chuck in blocks

240
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,770
going up a little bit like this and now

241
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,539
you're going to want to get two animals

242
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,610
inside that chamber right there very

243
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,620
simple for me could be a little bit more

244
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,599
challenging for you now if you need help

245
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,400
reading them a good tip is to check in

246
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,990
at some water down the bottom there as

247
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,280
you can see these guys start bobbing up

248
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,750
up and down which means that you can

249
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,280
easily click on them with the wheat I

250
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,139
don't actually need that because I can

251
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,690
just spam them in in creative mode and

252
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,460
then eventually you are going to get a

253
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,960
bunch of them up on the inside of this

254
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,699
place now unfortunately because we're

255
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,500
playing the snapshots right now these

256
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,120
will actually begin to take suffocation

257
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,889
damage when there's too many of them as

258
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,780
you can see right there so once you've

259
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,280
reached that limit just check in a

260
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,050
button wait for your friends to come

261
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,449
home and then tell them to give it a

262
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,979
press as you can see well it looks

263
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,900
pretty amazing doesn't it now the good

264
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,130
news is is that most of them died which

265
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,320
means there's not too much of a clean

266
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,360
operation I just think it's brilliant

267
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,759
your friends have houses in Minecraft

268
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,860
right every right that's the a perfectly

269
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,630
normal thing to do now one thing I will

270
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,430
say is if your friend's house is small a

271
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,070
bit like this little portaloo right here

272
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,690
I would suggest moving it using Pistons

273
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,430
now you can do this gradually so that

274
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,539
they don't really catch on to it or you

275
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,240
can do it very suddenly

276
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,830
aka move it hundreds of blocks off into

277
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,180
the distance so they don't really know

278
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,250
what's happened all you have to do is

279
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,050
chuck in a bunch of pistons like this

280
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,719
going up like that then you need to

281
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,270
place a blocks on all of their faces

282
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,680
just a bit like this and then behind all

283
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,450
of those Pistons that you're placing

284
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,130
some redstone blocks but before you do

285
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,810
it you need to make sure that there are

286
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,550
no gaps on the inside of the build

287
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,290
because otherwise the house will

288
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,180
collapse in on itself and that would be

289
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,250
bad so as you can see I've filled in all

290
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,720
of the air spaces with trapdoors so that

291
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,040
should be absolutely fine

292
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,050
I'm going to chuck in redstone box here

293
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,120
redstone blocks right there and there we

294
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,430
go we've pushed it by one block then you

295
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,740
break all of the redstone blocks place

296
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,450
in another set of blocks and rinse and

297
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,400
repeat this process until you've

298
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,750
travelled a decent distance let's just

299
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,970
say now I'm going to warn you

300
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,130
this is a big big project enormous

301
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,540
humongous massive it will take you a

302
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,950
very long time indeed for say for

303
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,570
example your friend is going away for a

304
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,300
week you could do this while they're

305
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,310
away and when they return they'll get

306
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,260
quite a shock what you need to do is you

307
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,600
need to pick the ugliest photo you could

308
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,360
possibly find of them import it into a

309
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,610
program known as sprite craft and then

310
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,380
build it now what Spri craft does is it

311
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,300
tells you what minecraft blocks to use

312
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,150
to get certain colours and as you can

313
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,220
see well it allows you to create things

314
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:44,310
that look a little bit like this now

315
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,840
that is my ugly mug right there and I

316
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,320
can tell you if I logged it into a

317
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,260
server and found this I would die with

318
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,510
both humiliation and also from laughing

319
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,970
far too much so your friends just built

320
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,380
a lovely organized sheep from all of the

321
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,420
sheep are in the correct pens they're

322
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,520
all the right colour it's absolutely

323
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,680
beautiful all you have to do is come

324
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,800
along and give this name tag to all of

325
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,450
the Sheep and suddenly mayhem absolute

326
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,190
mayhem all of the Sheep of changing

327
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,290
colour nobody knows what color they are

328
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,300
if you share the Sheep then it will show

329
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,220
the original colour but you can't tell

330
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,870
from looking at it and this is a very

331
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,420
simple way to mess with your friends and

332
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,770

all organic products for my doggie and

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,079
it's a good side note that if your dog

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,600
has any food allergies you can

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,610

prepare our mint and parsley starting

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,360
with our mint in front of me I've got a

31
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,610
cutting board and a bunch of fresh mint

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,650
stems you're just gonna pluck all of the

33
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,100
leaves off and I'm gonna have one of

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,540
these for me I love MIT Oh mom don't

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,720
isn't it funny when you smell things

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,670
like memories pop up my first kiss and

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,140
mojitos those were separate memories

38
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,509
you're just gonna take a sharp cutting

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,610
knife and we're gonna finely mince our

40
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,770
leaves just keep chopping until it's

41
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,170
super fine then I'm gonna do the same

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,990
thing with our parsley cutting off the

43
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,430
stems mincing finely and putting a half

44
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,130
a cup off to the side

45
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,020
now that our greens are ready in a

46
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,320
medium sized Bowl we are gonna combine

47
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,259
our oat flour almond meal and parsley

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,600
and mint then just whisk it together in

49
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,000
another medium-sized bowl we are gonna

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,030
mix together our wet ingredients we are

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,880
gonna mix our apple sauce coconut water

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,770
and coconut oil again using a whisk

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,690
we're gonna mix together we've got our

54
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,390
dry ingredients we've got our wet

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,090
ingredients

56
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:15,610
and now we're gonna pour our wet into

57
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,819
the dry then using a spatula we're just

58
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:21,490
gonna fold the two together under over

59
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:24,160
just like that once it looks like this

60
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,500
roll the dough into a ball and then it's

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,709
ready to roll out on your work surface

62
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,630
and I'm taking a little bit of o flour

63
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:34,120
sprinkling it down so that our treats

64
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,520
will not stick I'm rolling my dough out

65
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,709
to be about half an inch thick which is

66
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,330
much thicker than I roll out my cookies

67
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:42,489
once you cut them out you're just gonna

68
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:44,920
transfer them to a baking sheet lined

69
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,690

once they've baked and had plenty of

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,810
time to cool they're ready to serve to

102
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,630
gonna flip them like this and cut them

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,489
one more time down the middle next I'm

104
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,650
gonna cut them into cubes put them into

105
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,720
a medium saucepan and then take them

106
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,150
over to the stove fill your pan with

107
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,060
water until the potatoes are covered and

108
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,040
turn your heat to medium-high then cover

109
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,110
with a lid bring them to a boil and then

110
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,210
cook for an additional five to six

111
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,980
minutes after they're boiling you want

112
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,620
to cook them until the potatoes are soft

113
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,260
enough to pierce with a fork then remove

114
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,490
from heat and carefully drain the

115
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,560
potatoes in the sink

116
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,420
potatoes are hot off the stove I just

117
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,640
strain them into the sink and put them

118
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,710

take our potato masher and mash it up

121
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,910
just keep mashing until it's nice and

122
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,430
smooth and there's no more lumps or

123
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,410

mince our parsley same way we did before

132
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,640
in a large mixing bowl we are gonna

133
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,930

ingredients into our wet ingredients

142
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,650

143
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,210

144
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,010

roll it to be about half an inch thick

151
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,560
once your dough is rolled out we are

152
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,330

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,270
Ro: You guys, this is his first challenge,
and I’m kinda glad because

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,130
Ro: I went over the top this time. Jake: What,
what did you do? Tell me.

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,400
Ro: I teamed up with our friends over at California
Donuts, and they make

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,080
Ro: yummy donuts. Jake: OK. Ro: So 6 of them
are gonna be some of their

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,619
Ro: yummy donuts that you can get in their
store. And then 6 of them

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,969
Ro: they made 'em custom for us. That they don’t
sell in the stores, they’re

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,270
Ro: mystery flavors, I have no idea what they
are. Our friends went to

14
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,860
Ro: go pick them up. If you haven’t played
the donut challenge before,

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:46,050
Ro: it’s very easy. The both of us will
be blindfolded.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:46,560
Jake: Wha-chhh!

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,680
Ro: So we won’t be able to see anything.
And we’ll take a bite of each

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,340
Ro: donut, if we guess the flavor right, we
get a point.

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,699
Ro: And whoever get the most points at the
end of the game wins!

20
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:59,770
Ro: So, good sportsmanship. Jake: Yes, mmmhmmm.

21
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,070
Ro: May the best donut taster win today. Hmmmmm!

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,660
Ro: Alright, here’s our first donut!

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,140
Ro: Oh, oh this is tricky, here we go.

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,980
Jake: Oooh, oh! It’s wet!

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,620
Jake: Oooh. Ro: It’s on a plate. Jake: There,
there’s moisture.

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,729
Ro: Oooh, oooh, oooh! Wet!

27
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,830
Jake: Yeah, right? Ro: Wet! Jake: I’m gonna…

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,350
Jake: I think I have some ideas

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,280
Ro: Oh my gosh! This tastes like Thanksgiving!

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,280
Jake: Mmmm! Mmmhmmm!

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,500
Ro: Oh-ho-ho-ho! Hooo!

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,920
Ro: Jake, I didn’t have breakfast!

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,880
Jake: I haven’t eaten in years!

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,250
Ro: One, two, three.

35
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,220
Both: Mashed Potatoes and Gravy!

36
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,780
Jake: Oh! It was! Ro: It was! Jake: But there’s
no gravy,

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,909
Jake: but there’s definitely gravy!

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,740
Ro: Jake and I both get a point! And this
donut is delicious!

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,820
Ro: Super weird! Jake: It was really great!

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,060
Ro: Have you ever had a mashed potato donut
before? I have not!

41
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,700
Jake: Luna you want some mashed potatoes?
Ro: Oh you know she does!

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,400
Ro: Here you go, just a little, for you! Jake:
There you go!

43
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Ro: Good girl, good girl!

44
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,570
Jake: You just dropped it on my pants Luna!

45
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,770
Ro: Alright, donut number 2!

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,180
Ro: Here we go. Jake: OK.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,400
Ro: Pick up this donut.

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,500
Ro: Let me feel the top of this, what’s
on top here?

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,239
Ro: It’s very sweet… Jake: Oh! It’s
all coming together for me now.

50
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,780
Jake: I know, I know what this is.

51
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,840
Jake: It’s people.

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,500
Ro: I think it’s a cereal. It’s been awhile.
Jake: It has been awhile.

53
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,140
Ro: Do you eat cereal? Ah-hwuah-hwuah!

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,300
Ro: Do you eat cereal? Jake: Uh, I, no, not
really.

55
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,800
Jake: Yeah I usually just do a bowl of pineapple
and then maybe a side of tears.

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,040
Ro: One, two, three.

57
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,950
Jake: Fruit loops! Ro: Loops!

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,190
Ro: Frui! Oh! Jake: What did you say? Ro:
I said Loops!

59
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,610
Jake: That’s fine! Ro: But I was thinking…
With the.

60
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,550
Jake: You were thinking fruit loops. Ro: With
the toucan right?

61
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,700
Jake: Yeah, yeah! Toucan Sam! Ro: Toucan?

62
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,140
Ro: OK, let’s see. Jake: Oh we did it! Ro:
We did it! Jake: We did it!

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,600
Jake: Booyah!

64
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,980
Ro: Boom! A point for each of us.

65
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,220
Ro: Third donut.

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,120
Jake: Oh, OK. Ro: Oh what is this?

67
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,340
Jake: I think it smells… Ro: It smells savory!

68
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Jake: Mmmhmmm. Ro: Like, not as sweet, but
a food.

69
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,340
Ro: That’s good!

70
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,260
Ro: The donuts like a sweet crust, and then
the top…  Jake: Yeah.

71
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,879
Jake: I like that. Ro: Is like heaven!

72
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,849
Ro: I think I ordered this last night. Did
my voice just crack?

73
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:15,849
Jake: You went through puberty!

74
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:20,049
Jake: She did it everyone! Congratulations!
Mazel tov! You’re a boy!

75
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,920
Both: One, two, three.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
Both: Pizza!

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,349
Jake: Woooo! Look how cute the little pepperonis
are!

78
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,480
Ro: These are delicious! Jake: You want a
little pepperoni Luna?

79
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,780
Ro: Donut pizza, best thing ever. Good job
Luna!

80
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,000
Jake: Bring on ze donuts!

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,599
Jake: Oooh! Oooh! What’s on top? Ro: What’s
going on here?

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,980
Jake: Oh! The texture is familiar! Ro: I think
it’s a cookie.

83
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,590
Ro: OK, I gotta take a bite.

84
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,180
Ro: Let me taste one of these, just to make
sure.

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,160
Both: One, two, three.

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,339
Both: Oreos!

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,560
Jake: Cookies and cream? Ro: Cookies and cream!

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,580
Jake: OK, to be fair in our defense. Ro: Uh-huh?
Jake: The cookies are Oreos.

89
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,409
Jake: So… Ro: OK, so I think we should get
a 1/2 a point.

90
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,319
Jake: I think that’s 1/2 a point.

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,780
Ro: Oh my gosh, look, it looks like a little
panda!

92
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,560
Jake: Oh my gosh it does look like a… They
both look like a, aww!

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,939
Ro: It’s a little Panda! Jake: Hello!

94
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,549
Ro: Donut number 5!

95
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:21,729
Ro: Oh what is this? Jake: Oh, I think just
from touching it I think I

96
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:24,000
Jake: know what this is. Ro: Smells fishy!
Jake: Yep.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,479
Jake: Yeah…

98
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,320
Ro: Oooh. Jake: I don’t… I don’t want
it.

99
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,960
Jake: We had a good run, but then, everything
just fell apart.

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,550
Jake: Oh! It gets worse! Ro: Oooh that’s
salty!

101
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,940
Ro: I think I know what this is.

102
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,320
Jake: It is like someone condensed the ocean
and put it in a donut.

103
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,080
Jake: I feel like all of the water in my body
has just been absorbed!

104
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,550
Ro: Oh, do you need some water? Jake: No it’s
fine!

105
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,380
Ro: I got some! I got some!

106
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,690
Ro: Where’s your lips? Jake: They’re there.
On my face.

107
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,729
Ro: OK, here, here, here, here. Have some
water, cleanse the palette.

108
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,120
Ro: It was very salty.

109
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,880
Both: One, two, three.

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,759
Jake: Sushi. Ro: Musubi!

111
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,169
Ro: Yes, yes, yes! Musubi, musubi! Oh my gosh!

112
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:04,690
Ro: Wait, what did you say? Jake: Sushi. Ro:
There is seaweed on sushi.

113
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,330
Jake: It’s not, no? Ro: You don’t want
the point, 1/2 a point?

114
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,520
Ro: That's a no!

115
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,900
Ro: That’s a ding, a point for me!

116
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,199
Ro: And the only reason I know that is because
I lived in Hawaii for a little

117
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,910
Ro: bit and we ate a lot of musubi. Jake:
You know who’s gonna like the spam?

118
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,960
Jake: Little Luna! Ro: Can Dogs have a spam?

119
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,860
Jake: I’m pretty sure it’s just dog food
anyways!

120
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,270
Jake: Alright, what is this? This has some
things on it? Ro: Alright, let’s pick it up.

121
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,550
Jake: Oh! Ro: Oh it’s a bar! Jake: Oh, oh!

122
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,169
Ro: I know these because, this is a bar, not
your typical donut.

123
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,979
Jake: It is, yes, in a cylindrical-like shape.

124
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,570
Ro: Oooh, smells good, OK, here we go.

125
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,139
Ro: I’m tasting sweet and salty at the same
time!

126
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,119
Ro: I taste maple, like a, it taste like a
maple bar doesn’t it? Jake: Oh!

127
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,420
Both: One, two, three.

128
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,130
Ro: Maple bar! Jake: Bacon!

129
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,699
Ro: Maple Bacon. Jake: Yeah. Ro: So do we
each get 1/2 a point?

130
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:00,280
Ro: You guessed bacon, I guessed maple.

131
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,500
Ro: I brought the maple, you brought the bacon.
Ding-ding.

132
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,460
Jake: And together, maple-bacon. Ro: 1/2 a
point.

133
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,960
Ro: Mmmhmm. Jake: What!? What!? What!?

134
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,440
Jake: I don’t care! Ro: You guys, he’s
in a flipping mood today.

135
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,960
Ro: Onto the 7th donut and I’m really excited
because Jake is bringing

136
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,490
Ro: out the best in me. I don’t think we’ve
had a high scoring game like

137
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,919
Ro: this in a very long time.

138
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,460
Ro: Jake has a very big palette, because he
even travelled to, was it,

139
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,479
Ro: Spain? To go to the number 1 restaurant,
like, in the world at the time.

140
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,090
Jake: Mmmhmmm, you know, you just gotta, you
gotta take life by the horns,

141
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,970
Jake: and eat it!

142
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,960
Jake: I’m gonna take a smell. Oh! Ro: See
if we can redeem ourselves here.

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,300
Ro: Oh! Jake: Oh, I don’t like it.

144
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,240
Ro: OK… It just leaked on me!

145
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,600
Ro: It’s slimy, it’s cold, it smells,
uh…

146
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,840
Jake: Oh I know what this is… I wish I didn’t!

147
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,880
Jake: I just, I’m just immediately defeated.

148
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,360
Jake: It’s OK. Ro: What is this?

149
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,160
Jake: I’m just gonna have a little bit more,
just to, just to make sure it

150
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,460
Jake: is what I think it is. Ro: This is very
strong, I’m still having a gag.

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,160
Jake: Oh yeah. Ro: Oh I can’t!

152
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,080
Jake: Oh yeah it is what I think it is. Ro:
Oh Jake.

153
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Jake: Confirmed… I figured it out.

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Both: One, two, three.

155
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,060
Ro: Dead Fish! Jake: Durian!

156
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
Jake: It is durian! Woo!

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Jake: Oh, yeah, durian is a fruit, I had it
when I was in the Philippines.

158
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,569
Jake: So this is an interesting fact. Ro:
Hmmm?

159
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,039
Jake: Uh, in public transit you’re not allowed
to have Durian, because it

160
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,759
Jake: smells so bad. People like it. Ro: I
would not suggest that this

161
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,879
Ro: become a donut flavor, anywhere!

162
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,760
Ro: Jake, I can’t believe you took another
bite of that one.

174
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,599
Jake: It’s not saying anything.

175
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,139
Ro: Is a huckleberry a popular berry?

176
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:19,340

211
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,310
Ro: This is probably a good time, I should
ask you, are you allergic to anything?

212
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,500
Ro: Peanuts? Jake: Yeah, just peanuts and
chocolate and…

213
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,320

219
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,380
Ro: OK, is it gross if I open it up? Jake:
Oh, look at that.

that was very hot. Jake: Ohhh!

254
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,480

Jake gets a full point.

255
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,440
Ro: Onto the last donut!

256
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,420

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,760
Ro: OK, so you said peanut butter and I said
Reeses. Jake: Rwrrphhrr prrdffdrr.

272
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Ro: It’s chocolate peanut butter, so I’m
gonna give myself a point,

273
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,740
Ro: Because it is Reeses on the top and that
is chocolate peanut butter.

274
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,110
Ro: And then Jake you said peanut butter right?

275
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,139

148
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,300
stupid and your judicial system is

149
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,699
nothing more than an elaborate hoax run

150
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,600
by the very fact that Brooks was created

151
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:29,459

152
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:34,060

an agreement with Pakistan starting

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,120
construction on the future

project is a series of roads railways

and gas and oil pipelines they run

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,430
roughly 1,800 miles between the two

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,859
countries giving China a direct path to

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,060
the Indian Ocean for decades the two

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,890
countries have supported each other

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,710
politically economically and militarily

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,349
with so much cooperation we wanted to

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,740
know why do China and Pakistan love each

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,020
other

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,540
well relations between the two countries

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,550
go back to the Chinese Civil War where

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,320
communist forces took over mainland

18
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,230
China while the existing government fled

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,149
to Taiwan Pakistan was the first Muslim

20
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,829
country to recognize the new Chinese

21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,410
government and to break ties with the

22
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,090
one in Taiwan since that time China and

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,190
Pakistan have forged an important

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,469
regional relationship on one side

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,899
Pakistan provides an important link for

26
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,129
China to the United States as well as to

27
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,620
Muslim countries in the area

28
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,390
in fact Pakistan was instrumental in

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,780
facilitating President Richard Nixon's

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,970
first visit to China in 1972 this visit

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,520
shifted the balance of the Cold War and

32
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,860
allied Communist China with the US and

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,990
against the Soviet Union on the other

34
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,000
side China provides a cultural and

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,680
political barrier against India in the

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,330
region preventing it from gaining too

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,670
much influence in East and Central Asia

38
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,950
in addition to linking foreign relations

39
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,060
the two powers militarily depend on each

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,610
other with a free trade agreement

41
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,400
Pakistan buys more Chinese weapons than

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,250
any other country accounting for half of

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,380
China's arms sales in April 2015 China

44
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,869
sold eight submarines to Pakistan for

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,659
five billion dollars China's largest

46
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,220
military sale ever

47
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,720
additionally some including Chinese

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,520
diplomats have compared their

49
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,040
relationship to that of the US and

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,450
Israel in international relations the

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,670
two countries support each other

52
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,409
unilaterally while China backs

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,469
Pakistan's claim in the Kashmir region

54
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,360
against India Pakistan advocates for

55
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,450
China's authority in regions like Tibet

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,890
and Taiwan a Pakistani ambassador

57
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,360
described their friendship as higher

58
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,640
than the mountains deeper than the

59
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,280
oceans stronger than steel dearer than

60
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,900
eyesight sweeter than honey and so on

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,730
the two also have economic

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,829
dependence China is Pakistan's

63
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,810
second-largest trade partner and a huge

64
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:20,879
investor in Pakistani infrastructure and

65
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,890
shipping routes the two countries trade

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,489
roughly 10 to 12 billion dollars a year

67
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,409
as of 2013 but in particular Pakistan is

68
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,599
the only Muslim nation known to possess

69
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,310
nuclear weapons and the majority of its

70
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,250
missile and nuclear materials have

71
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,470
reportedly come from China clearly China

72
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,079
and Pakistan's relationship is mutually

73
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,209
beneficial in fact more Pakistanis hold

74
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,980
a favorable view of China than any other

75
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,750
foreign country throughout their mutual

76
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,370
histories the two have relied on and

77
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,989
strengthened each other in the coming

78
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,940
years their developmental goals will be

79
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,220
intertwined with billions in shared

80
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,500

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,959
Pakistan are expected to grow fuelled by

380,Viner Amanda Cerny EXPOSES LeLe Pons In Major BFF Feud,Pef5dLcGpfU,"More Celebrity News ►► http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews

Vine star Amanda Cerny publicly ends her friendship with Lele Pons after some seriously shady behavior. 
All of y’all are about to re-evaluate you best friends after I still this tea. Just yesterday, Viner Amanda Cerny announced on Twitter that she is OFFICIALLY dumping her former BFF, LELE PONS. LELE is the most followed girl on Vine and apparently had it out for her former best friend seeing that she would delete photos AND videos that were doing well on Amanda’s personal socials behind her back. 
Amanda posted a blog post explaining that six months ago she noticed her most popular instagram posts as well as youtube videos were mysteriously being deleted… 
She explained QUOTE:  Lele Pons was supposed to be my best friend… Then I began to notice my photos being deleted, my videos being deleted and my account being put on private so no one could follow me. I immediately blamed The social media platforms and wouldn't even think it was her. This was happening to me nonstop until August.""
Recently at a barbeque, things started to click for Amanda. She continued on her blog writing QUOTE: we were all playing a fun game of charades and I see Lele get up as I'm telling a joke. I look over my shoulder and see Lele on her phone snapchatting and then realize wait… That's my phone. Take my phone back and my photo was deleted. So I knew it was her at that moment it all made sense.""
Amanda then confronted Lele, who eventually came clean… The very next morning when Amanda asked Lele about the situation she replied by saying QUOTE: 'No way we are best friends I would never do that.'  
Amanda then said QUOTE: She came up to my apartment later and I asked her face-to-face and she looked like she was lying and I demanded the truth from her. She admitted to it all. She would even be by my side when I would realize my things been deleted and comforting me saying, 'Oh my goodness good thing I'm here and we are such good friends I will help you with this.' So manipulative.""' 
Lele apparently told fans that Amanda deleted her videos first and that is why all of this started but Amanda fired back saying “she’s lying to all of our friends saying how sorry she is for what she did and then going and doing this? She is still trying to ruin me LOL for no reason.""
Amanda is also going HAM on twitter retweeting everyone that is showing her support on social media like this photo that was captioned Shame on you @lelepons !!! What you did to @AmandaCerny is soo insane!! #TeamAmanda
While Lele hasn’t spoked out directly on the matter, she has been busy posting messages that seem to be about the drama like this tweet that reads “People will only bring you down when they have nothing to bring them up -my little cousin” https://twitter.com/lelepons/status/775385487666188288 
Hmmmmm, all seems very shady to me… I can’t believe Amanda and Lele were BFF’s and Lele really had it out for Amanda the whole time… DRAMA. Watch your back, kids.
Most importantly I do what to know what all of you are thinking about the internet drama. Who’s side are you on? Can you believe this is a real thing we’re talking about? Let me hear it in the comment section below, then click right here to watch an episode of beauty break with GRACE HELBIG!!! I’m ryland Adams, thanks for watching, see you soon!

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,970
take my phone back and my photo was

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,820
deleted so I knew it was her at that

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,159
moment it all made sense Amanda then

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,409
confronted Lele who eventually came

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,750
clean the very next morning when Amanda

40
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,909
asked Lele about the whole situation she

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,530
replied by saying quote no way we are

42
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,479
best friends I would never do that

43
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,220
Amanda then said quote she came up to my

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,710
apartment later and I asked her

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,659
face-to-face and she looked like she was

46
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,060
lying and I demanded the truth from her

47
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,950
she admitted to it all she would even be

48
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,049
by my side when I would realize my

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,479
thing's been deleted and comforting me

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,119
saying oh my goodness good thing I'm

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,329
here and we are such good friends I will

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,219
help you with this so manipulative Lele

53
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,950
apparently told fans that Amanda deleted

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:06,990
her videos first and that is why all of

55
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,369
this started but Amanda fired back

56
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,530
saying she is lying to our friends

57
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,959
saying how sorry she is for what she did

58
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,780
and then going and doing this she is

59
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,470
still trying to ruin me lol for no

60
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,480
reason

61
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,340
amanda is going ham on Twitter

62
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,200
retweeting everyone that is showing her

63
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,129
support on social media like this photo

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,890
that was captioned

65
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:30,430
shame on you at Lele pons what you did

66
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,640
to Amanda Kearney is so insane hashtag

67
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,620
team Amanda while Lele hasn't spoken out

68
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,840
directly on the matter she has been busy

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,549
posting messages that seem to be about

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,590
the drama like this tweet that reads

71
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:43,750
people will only bring you down when

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,540
they have nothing to bring them up my

73
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,980
little cousin all of this seems very

74
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,769
shady to me

75
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,349
I can't believe Amanda and Lele were

76
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,659
BFFs and Lele really had it out for

77
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,150
Amanda the whole time drama

"
381,FAKE YOUTUBERS THE TRUTH,0twUECqulmo,"Hi. My name's Hoytt and I'm the sound technician for Rose and Rosie's channel. I thought I'd upload this footage of them discussing how fake the YouTube industry is as well as exposing them as fake YouTubers themselves. You need the truth. I'm sick of how they're exploiting the LGBTQ+ community for fame and fortune. I actually don't care about that but I can say out of experience that Rose is better in bed. I hacked this account because I'm a white male and can do whatever the fuck I want.

Monica whatever whatever they obviously

221
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,389
wanted one person to represent all those

222
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:34,309
countries like in story arc so we all

223
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,689
seemed a bit diverse team whatever and

224
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:37,550

225
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:39,649
from like down and out worked you know I

226
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,309
just thought that well what I don't get

227
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:42,679
is right

228
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:45,589
Shannon's acting another role to know so

229
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:46,999
like I know it's getting ready it's okay

230
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:48,619
because she I think she acted like gay

231
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,379
in this other thing as well but like

232
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:53,659
what's can happen when their people are

233
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:56,869
all she's an actress like what's gonna

234
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,819
happen I know she's acting and actress

235
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:01,219
look like it's gonna it's too close war

236
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,829
it's like when Joey your friends was an

237
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:06,349
actor on friends wears like but she's in

238
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:08,599
it oh yeah man I'll hover if she marries

239
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:10,309
or 10-year to try and right minute right

240
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,629
it's very clever script writing yeah

241
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:13,249
it's just like it's throwing you all

242
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:15,319
that's too much me I just think keep it

243
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:16,969
simple like sounding it like your

244
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,829
character not understanding things then

245
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:19,699

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,739
age of 1 I was I was taking away from my

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,899

21
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,670
unfit parent like you know I put on the

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,410
street I wound up as literally one of

23
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,120
the morons on the street stealing to

24
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,120
survive as I've grown up I

25
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,750
I want to make something better about

26
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,129
myself you know I want to be whatever

27
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,780
view everybody else wants to be

28
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,059
successful rich and happy I want to

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,680
become a doctrine and engineering and so

30
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,489
far I can take apart anything we kind of

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,019
not put it back together

32
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,210
I was mechanically inclined and now I'm

33
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,320
an ASE certified mechanic basically

34
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,580
loneliness

35
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,580
wandering mystery

36
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,330
I read of your real friends I really see

37
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,299
people that you know act like they're my

38
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,119
friends but they're really

39
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,220
get something atomy or you know you

40
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,990
don't have anyone you can trust I really

41
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,160
you seem like a great guy why he feels

42
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,700
why do you feel lonely and why do you

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,110
feel like you don't have any friends

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,970
maybe you're overthinking it a little

45
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,190
bit and feel like you might be lonely

46
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,810
but in reality people do would probably

47
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,790
want to talk to you and find you

48
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,350
interesting just I want to see you smile

49
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,480
though I don't want to say upset yeah

50
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,970
then I hope you find trustworthy friends

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,340

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,220

for me every time there's a clear dark

96
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,220

384,The Deaths of Chromie Guide - 7.2.5 Scenario,537b-bvOwg0,"The Deaths of Chromie is a new single-player scenario coming to World of Warcraft: Legion in the upcoming Patch 7.2.5. Doing the Deaths of Chromie will earn you a unique transmog set for your armor type and potentially a bronze whelp pet, but you won't be finishing the Deaths of Chromie on your first attempt. The Chromie Scenario coming in 7.2.5 is designed to be played repeatedly and becomes more attainable as you earn rep and learn more about the attacks orchestrated against Chromie. 

I STRONGLY recommend that you turn on Sound-Dialogue when playing the Deaths of Chromie in 7.2.5 because Chromie's voice acting is something else. The whole Chromie Scenario experience was very fun and I'm excited for it to hit live Legion servers after the patch 7.2.5 release date in June. The time-loop theme of the Deaths of Chromie is very reminiscent of movies like Groundhog Day or the Edge of Tomorrow. I got an almost Dark Souls vibe from the concept of playing an event repeatedly to gain knowledge, perspective and practice. Play the Deaths of Chromie scenario in patch 7.2.5 to save Chromie! Apologies if my voice is a little bit scratchy-I was coming down with a cold. I re-uploaded this video to fix a minor issue with the music volume in the first minute- thanks for your patience! It's otherwise unchanged. 

Let me know what you think and check out my channel for battle pet guides, other WoW videos and a weekly vlog!

00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,530
Hi!

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,270
I'm Hazel, and this is a complete guide to
the Deaths of Chromie scenario coming to WoW

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,490
in patch 7.2.5.

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,799
This video will contain super-duper-mega-spoilers
for the scenario, so if you're avoiding spoilers

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:13,009
you gotta leave right now.

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,770
You'll be able to play the scenario on live
servers once patch 7.2.5 releases, most likely

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,700
sometime in June.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,750
To get started, you Pick up the quest 'The
Day that Chromie Dies' in the Violet Citadel.

9
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,610
I don't see any prerequisites so you should
be able to start right away.

10
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,390
This is a repeatable scenario that's designed
to be repeated in order to succeed, sort of

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,619
like Withered Army Training.

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:36,100
The whole thing is very Edge of Tomorrow,
Groundhog day.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,010
Your goal in the scenario is to prevent the
death of Chromie that she has foreseen for

14
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,390
herself at Wyrmrest Temple.

15
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,390
To 'win' the scenario, you need to prevent
eight different attacks on Chromie, all within

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,420
the fifteen minute timer.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,781
Each time you try, you'll earn rep with Chromie
that allows you to buff her at the start of

18
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:51,890
the scenario.

19
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,940
You'll need to first tackle attacks at the
four Dragonshrines in order to unlock the

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,460
other four attacks.

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,649
Your first runthrough of each Dragonshrine
involves a one-time-only questline, and completing

22
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:04,280
the shrine is expedited every time after that.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,630
It is literally not humanly possible to win
the scenario on your first try, so don't worry

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,920
about making it all the way.

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,479
In the instance, your player level is scaled
to 112 and your item level is scaled to 1000,

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,320
so you don't need to worry too much about
your gear.

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,409
Your legendaries and set bonuses do still
function like normal, though, so wear your

28
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,690
best damage set.

29
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,650
While the first four dragonshrines are much
faster on subsequent tries, unfortunately

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:31,170
it looks like the second half of the attacks
is the same each time you attempt the scenario.

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,590
That means that even with all four shrines
prepared ahead of time, you're going to need

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,740
both buffs and practice to finish before our
favourite little gnome dragon eats it.

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,790
As you do stuff in the scenario, you'll earn
rep directly with Chromie.

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,960
You start off as a WHELPLING and eventually
work your way up to a chrono lord.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,530
You'll need increasingly higher levels of
rep in order to research new talents for Chromie

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,469
to use as she aids you in the instance.

37
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:56,490
You will absolutely need those talents to
finish, and there are lengthy research times

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,030
associated with the later tiers.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,890
As it stands, nobody's going to be finishing
this on day 1.

40
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,399
Chromie rep appears to only be relevant for
those talents, so once you're done with the

41
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,479
scenario there's no more reason to grind it.

42
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,879
Well, not unless you're one of those people
that needs EVERY rep on your pane capped,

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,860
in which case knock yourself out.

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,659
We'll take a look at Chromie's talents in
detail later in this guide.

45
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:21,310
You can do the four dragonshrines in any order,
but the first one I swung by was the Emerald

46
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,310
Dragonshrine.

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,160
Kill owls and lashers to collect Fibers and
Plumes, which you combine to create a Nightmare

48
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Catcher.

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,600
Use that near an Ancient to enter the nightmare
and kill the oogly booglys who are oogling

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
him.

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,480
Repeat that process three times and you'll
find out about a Satyr boss by the dragon

52
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,160
palm at the lake.

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,489
Go kill him and the green shrine is done.

54
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,710
On future attempts, you can go right to the
Satyr without having to boogle the ooglies

55
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,530
all over again.

56
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,010
The red dragonshrine is under attack from
three types of Undead.

57
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,590
Kill the three leaders to collect a Soul Crystal
Fragment from each, and combine those to get

58
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,950
your next step.

59
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,241
To the surprise of nobody, the soul crystal
sends you into the base of the tree to kill

60
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,241
a Lich.

61
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:01,090
The next time you come back here, you can
just fly right into the tree and get him.

62
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,879
The Azure dragonshrine has a bunch of mana-creature
shenanigans as usual.

63
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,860
Kill fiends and wyrms to collect 50 Darkened
Scraps of Vellum, which send you up to kill

64
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,689
a voidlord boss on the floating platform.

65
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:14,349
The next time you do it, fly straight to the
platform.

66
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:18,580
The Obsidian Dragonshrine has our old pal
Wrathion to chat with, which is kind of intriguing.

67
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,879
You go into the shrine and fight your way
to the very end to kill a big fiery boneshard

68
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,959
boss.

69
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,480
After that, you learn that there's a sneaky
dreadlord outside to the right of the cave

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
entrance.

71
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,470
Kill him, and next time you're here you can
skip straight to him.

72
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,291
All the Dragonshrine bosses are present but
invisible on future attempts, so you need

73
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,150
to remember where they are and go stand on
them to reveal them.

74
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,739
Your first victory against the green shrine
Satyr will give you a Chronoshard unlocking

75
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,970
a portal to Andorhal.

76
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,629
You find a version of Chromie trapped in the
inn, unable to leave because of the big Horde

77
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,629
cannon.

78
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,250
Maybe Horde players deal with an Alliance
cannon, who knows.

79
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,190
Either way you need to take it out, and you
can't just walk up to it and kill it.

80
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,379
Believe me, I tried.

81
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,640
There are four horde captains in Andorhal-
kill each of them and loot items from them

82
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,650
that will help you kill the cannon.

83
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,260
Using all of the items will remove both of
the Cannon's buffs and take it down to a quarter

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,600
health, at which point you can kill it.

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,630
Your first time through the Blue shrine get
you a Chronoshard for the Mount Hyjal portal.

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,609
Right ahead, we've got an injured Chromie
hanging out on the ground.

87
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:20,560
Stay by her side and defeat waves of enemies
as quickly as possible to rescue her and defend

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,250
the attack.

89
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,930
The Ruby shrine boss gives you a chronoshard
to take you back to Strathholme.

90
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,770
You arrive right before Arthas does, and we
know how this story goes.

91
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,180
This is by far the most emotional part of
the scenario.

92
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,490
You pick up a quest from Emery in an inn,
and run around picking up items from vendors

93
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,720
in a questline to protect orphans and help
out Emery's crush.

94
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,110
He gives you a key, at which point the citizens
you were helpling have turned to undead and

95
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,340
you need to escape through the town hall.

96
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:54,630
Chromie's voice acting comes off as particularly
insensitive at this point.

97
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,180
I found it hilarious but I may be a bad person.

98
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,960
Now, fight your way through Stratholme following
the same route you take in the Caverns of

99
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
time dungeon.

100
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,420
Up the stairs, through the bookcase, and down
the street to where we used to fight Mal'ganis.

101
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,740
He's not around, but Nezar'Azret is holding
down the fort so go ahead and kill her instead.

102
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,420
This whole shard took me right up to the fifteen
minute mark, all by itself.

103
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,789
You would think that on future attempts you
would still have the friggin key to skip ahead

104
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:21,910
to the town hall but nope, you gotta start
from scratch.

105
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,430
That's gonna suck.

106
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,970
The Dreadlord outside the Black shrine gives
you the final chronoshard portal to take you

107
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,120
to the Well of Eternity.

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,850
Here, just fight your way through the dungeon
like you did in Cataclysm, only backwards.

109
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,840
If it's been a while or you never did this
one, just check out my handy map.

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,830
Reach the beginning of the dungeon to defend
the final attack.

111
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,570
Presumably doing all 8 bosses within 15 minutes
wins, but there's no way in heck that you're

112
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,660
doing that without some or all of Chromie's
talents.

113
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,900
Her upgrades function a lot like Class Order
Hall research.

114
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,761
Each new tier requires a new level of reputation
with Chromie, and starting with tier 3 there

115
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,410
are some significant research times before
the buff can take effect.

116
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,870
On tier 1, you choose between Time Stop and
Acceleration.

117
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,830
Either one gives you a bonus 5% damage and
healing.

118
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,900
The enemies aren't too difficult to handle,
so I recommend taking Acceleration for a base

119
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,950
20% to mounted and movement speed.

120
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,330
You're gonna need it.

121
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,490
On tier 2, we have Accelerated Aggression
to turn Chromie into a tank, or Rapid Recovery

122
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,960
to make her a healer.

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,889
Either choice gives you a bonus 5% health,
and most specs will want to choose Rapid Recovery.

124
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,720
On tier 3, we have Dragon's Determination
or Chrono Charisma.

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,789
Determination reduces Chromie's damage taken
by 20%, while Charisma gives you increased

126
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:34,240
reputation gain in the later minutes of the
scenario.

127
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,020
If Chromie dies, you get kicked out regardless
of how much time you had.

128
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,900
The rep gain sounds really good at first,
but as you do the scenario you'll find yourself

129
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,389
often leaving early once you know you don't
have enough time to get to another objective.

130
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,190
You're also more likely to be bottlenecked
by research speed than rep, so I went with

131
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,849
Dragon's Determination to keep Chromie extra
safe.

132
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:56,000
Either way you get a bonus 5% speed.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,860
On tier 4, we have Insight or Blessing of
the Bronze Dragonflight.

134
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,301
Insight lets you track nearby time chests
on your map, which can contain Sands of Time

135
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,870
for useful buffs.

136
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,250
The Blessing improves your Sands of TIme to
grant you Bronze Drakes more often.

137
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,259
The Bronze Drake buff allows you to instantly
clear a dragonshrine without going there,

138
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,460
which will rapidly speed up your run.

139
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,600
The tier 4 bonus is 10% damage and healing.

140
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,250
Tier 5 is a single talent, increasing the
drop rate of Sands of Time by 100%.

141
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,520
We'll take a closer look at exactly what Sands
do next, but trust me when I say that that's

142
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,930
really juicy.

143
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,470
You'll also get 10% more health.

144
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,010
Tier 6 has you choose between Infinite Velocity
and Continous Keepsakes.

145
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,319
Velocity gives you portals to the shrines,
cutting travel time out of the equation.

146
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,479
Keepsakes increases the chance for you to
get an item that instantly clears a specific

147
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,880
one of the four chronoshard attacks from your
Sands of Time.

148
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,550
When combined with the extra Sands from Tier
5 and all the movement speed we've collected,

149
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,409
Keepsakes seems better.

150
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,599
Those second attacks, Stratholme in particular
are huge timesinks and getting an insta-clear

151
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,759
or three is the only way you're going to make
it on time.

152
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,449
The bonus here is yet another 10% speed.

153
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,639
The final buff requires Chrono Lord rep, and
takes a whopping 5 days to research.

154
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,670
Chromie can summon a dragon that crashes into
your foes, hopefully dealing a substantial

155
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,670
amount of damage.

156
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,600
At this point you get a bonus 50% to damage,
healing, health and speed so if you haven't

157
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,650
won the scenario already you should be able
to now.

158
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,860
The Sands of Time drop from mobs, bosses and
you can get a quest to get extras from doing

159
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,500
a specific shrine boss each run.

160
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,919
Use them to gain one of two buffs that are
randomly selected from the following list

161
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,080
Get 25% rep gain, 10% damage, take 10% reduced
damage, get 10% run speed, extend the scenario

162
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,670
duration, auto-complete a dragonshrine or
auto-complete a specific portal challenge.

163
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,850
These buffs stack and you'll get quite a few
Sands, so do the quicker challenges first

164
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,430
so you have more buffs for the longer ones.

165
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,150
Sands can also grant you a pouch with 30ish
gold, which is a bit of a slap in the face.

166
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,430
If you know you're not on a success attempt
and you're just grinding rep or unlocking

167
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,230
a shrine boss, go for it.

168
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,380
Last, you can get 10 timewarped badges for
you to keep.

169
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,580
Take the badges if you're on a throwaway attempt,
and stack up the buffs if you're trying to

170
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,160
seriously make it.

171
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,650
It's very cool to have an alternate source
of Timewarped badges outside of timewalking,

172
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,440
and I hope there's some reason to repeat the
scenario now and then even after the first

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
time you win.

174
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,130
With the exception of the last two these buffs
are only in effect for your current run of

175
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,310
the Deaths of Chromie, and you cannot stockpile
Sands to use in a future run.

176
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,730
Due to the research time of Chromie's talents,
I was not able to win the scenario on the

177
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,730
PTR.

178
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,080
When you do win, though, there are some rewards
up for grabs.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,170
You'll earn a unique set of transmog for your
armor type, shown here.

180
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,070
The cloth in particular looks nice, thanks
Blizz.

181
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,740
There's also a mysterious bronze Test Dragon
pet in the 7.2.5 ptr pet journal, which could

182
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,810
be from finishing or an achievement.

183
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,010
My guess is that the whelp is from finishing
your Chromie rep grind and becoming a Chrono-Lord.

184
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,200
You'll get some artifact power tokens throughout
the whole questline as well, so I'd say it's

185
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,270
worth doing for most people.

186
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,370
So, that is the Deaths of Chromie!

187
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,910
It's a fun experience, and I think it has
just enough time-gating to be nicely paced.

188
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,800
It took me about 2 to three hours of gameplay
to complete all eight attacks at least once

189
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,430
and then get held up by the talent research
time.

190
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,890
You can probably do it faster because I just
told you everything.

191
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,890
Thanks for watching!

192
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,060
Let me know what you think, please consider
leaving a like if you made it this far through

193
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,800
listening to me talk and have a wonderful,
wonderful day.

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,500
Bye!

00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,629
I promised you flirting animation in the

BRR BRR BRR big shocker I don't like it

personality that I'm not one to partake

words of flattery I don't think I've

ever flirted in my entire life come to

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,390
think of it okay well I did this one

10
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,519
time by accident but I'll get to that

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,140
later on I'm more of a make someone feel

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,480
good and just overall let them know I

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,429
care about them kind of person I have no

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,109
courage to do anything else all I can

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,960
imagine is me just trying to approach

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,540
someone being like hey there I have a

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,290
girlfriend oh my god same we have so

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,180
much in common

19
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,250
oh and even if I somehow got past the

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,930
initial flirty introduction mile of

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,100
Smalltalk skills won't get me very far

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,690
with anything anyway

23
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,969
okay so the first time I ever tried to

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
be a confident flirty person or whatever

25
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,360
was with this one friend I had I liked

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,649
them at the time and we hung out a lot

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,629
and one time we were just sitting on

28
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,670
their bed just chillin and talkin just

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,829
buds being buds and my mind just starts

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,140
going okay you've never done anything

31
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,450
close to flirty in your entire life who

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,860
even are you get your crap together just

33
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,290
do something let's go

34
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,210
Gees come on I basically bullied myself

35
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,220
into submission which I didn't even know

36
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,869
was possible but congrats to me I guess

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,060
I peer pressured myself without any

38
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,970
peers so we were just talking and I just

39
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,479
wrapped my arm around them like with no

40
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,189
warning

41
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,369
they were like mid-sentence and I just

42
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,170
liked it and I immediately regretted it

43
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,000
like okay no this is not what I want

44
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,310
anymore what I convinced myself to do

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,290
this god dang it cutting the story short

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,450
we just remained friends and honestly

47
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,490
I'm glad we did I realized I prefer this

48
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,140
person much more as a friend and I'm

49
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,909
glad we didn't start a relationship if

50
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
anything we just became closer as pals

51
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,920
they're literally one of my best friends

52
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,689
now they also watched my videos so hey

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,579
you're probably expecting me to say this

54
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,649
is awkward but you're wrong we're best

55
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,320
friends sorry you can't laugh at my self

56
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,909
deprecation this time ah just a side

57
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,770
tangent I don't understand why people

58
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,390
just stop talking to someone just

59
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,579
because they don't share mutual feelings

60
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,469
with them like okay so you like someone

61
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,329
enough to possibly consider starting a

62
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,399
closer relationship which means you

63
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,920
already enjoy their company personality

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,849
and overall them as a person and just

65
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,790
because they don't share the same

66
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,469
romantic feel

67
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,060
is back you all of a sudden don't want

68
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:18,579
to associate with them anymore that

69
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,349
makes absolutely no sense - the

70
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:22,150
relationship you - sound like you could

71
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,920
have a freaking bomb friendship since

72
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,170
you theoretically should be able to get

73
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,269
along perfectly I mean if you consider

74
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,040
them as an adequate possible partner I

75
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,959
don't know it just doesn't make sense to

76
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,280
me unless you're a douche bag and you

77
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,150
only like that person for their looks

78
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,370
and nothing else

79
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,769
another part to flirting is the texting

80
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,900
the messaging the sliding and the DMZ

81
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,280
and I don't really do that either but I

82
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,900
have something to say about it so I

83
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,489
guess I understand why you would want to

84
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,170
wait a few minutes to text someone back

85
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,030
because you don't want to seem clingy or

86
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,250
something but why do people wait like

87
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,989
more than 10 minutes that's such a waste

88
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,280
of time and it kind of comes off that

89
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,530
you don't really care that you're

90
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,090
talking to them which is the opposite of

91
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,370
what you're feeling why can't we show

92
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,049
when we appreciate someone anymore also

93
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,000
I know people who want to text someone

94
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,189
they like as little as possible because

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,540
I don't know again it makes it seem like

96
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:07,930
they don't want to be texting them or

97
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,909
something

98
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,859
well almost make it a competition to try

99
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,659
and leave the conversation first like

100
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,430
Congrats you went on finding a way to

101
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,590
make them be the last two texts in your

102
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,750
conversation you know your prize is not

103
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,269
getting to talk to the person you want

104
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,099
to talk to putting it that way doesn't

105
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,569
make it seem all that appealing does it

106
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,430
so now I'm sure you're wanting me to

107
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,290
tell you stories that make me kind of

108
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,510
died a bit inside but provide you with

109
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,310
entertainment and you're right let's

110
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,870
start with awkward first date shall we

111
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,729
during my junior year of high school

112
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,169
after our homecoming dance my group of

113
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:40,540
friends and I wanted to go bowling

114
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:42,879
because fun I didn't have a date

115
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,650
obviously at the bowling place next to

116
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,599
our Lane were a group of people around

117
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,030
the same age as us and out of the blue

118
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:50,949
one of my friends just goes hey will you

119
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,010
guys take a picture with us so it looks

120
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:55,840
like we have dates Rachel so we took

121
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,209
pictures with these random people and

122
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,489
the one that was my date date was like

123
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,199
huh you should send that to me and me

124
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:05,979
being freaking innocent and clueless

125
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:10,659
just goes okay wait I don't have your

126
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:12,699
number wait did I just how did I do that

127
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:14,470
so bla bla bla I had this person's

128
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:16,239
number now and I was like oh yeah I

129
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,720
totally meant to be all smooth like that

130
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,479
to my friends but in reality technically

131
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,130
yeah I have no idea what I'm doing they

132
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,530
end up asking me to the movies and I was

133
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,210
like okay but my parents didn't

134
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,950
me to go alone so they made me invite

135
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,480
Kate and her boyfriend at the time to go

136
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,250
as a double-date so we all go to the

137
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,889
movies and since I literally don't know

138
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,200
anything about this person we didn't

139
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,840
know what to talk about the whole time

140
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,780
it was all just flop conversations like

141
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,470
so how was your day good how about you

142
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:51,220
good what's your favorite color

143
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,430
ah it was really uh I can't uh ah

144
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,230
it was scarring like I'm serious I will

145
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,210
never accept any movie invitations

146
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,100
unless it's with close friends or family

147
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,410
ever all that comes to my mind when I

148
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,940
think of movie theaters are just

149
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,380
flashbacks like I don't want to relive

150
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,660
that I already lived through it once

151
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,310
that's quite enough no more please so

152
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,050
that story wasn't too bad just awkward

153
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,540
tension come on let's bump it up a bit

154
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,040
awkward first kiss so hey my first date

155
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,780
was with someone I literally didn't know

156
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,400
you think I'd learned my listen and kind

157
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,470
of get to know someone before I accepted

158
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,300
date invitations right wrong hint I'm

159
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,790
bad at saying no to people also this is

160
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,500
my second date ever just putting that

161
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,570
fact out there during my freshman year

162
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,060
in college this person invited me to go

163
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,790
on a date and yeah I didn't know them

164
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,040
either like at all I've learned my

165
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,960
lesson now okay we meet up and decide to

166
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,550
eat at a restaurant and hey oh I'll save

167
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,830
some time just by saying it was going

168
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,570
very similar to my first date exposition

169
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,610
time my college has this Mountaineer it

170
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:48,370
called a mountain and people like to

171
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,640
hike it what it's really not even a hike

172
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,320
more like walking up at a mild angle so

173
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,060
we wind up walking up a mountain and

174
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,250
sitting on a rock platform at the top

175
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,260
and we continue attempting at a normal

176
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,479
conversation not really succeeding at

177
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,610
one point they put their arm around me

178
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,140
come to think of it all these stories

179
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,550
are kind of coming full circle and I

180
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,680
never realized that I'm kind of freaking

181
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,990
out and I kind of start just panicking

182
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,280
to myself okay see where this is going I

183
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,260
don't know if I want to end up kissing

184
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,090
them like I literally know nothing about

185
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,830
this person again and I haven't kissed

186
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,810
anyone yet what is even happening right

187
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,700
now Oh golly jeez and all of a sudden

188
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,950
they grab my face and turn it towards

189
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,570
them and I'm going I'm sick I say what's

190
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,700
about to happen but crap I don't know if

191
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,320
I want to kiss them yet well I ran out

192
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,180
of time so anyone who just happens to

193
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,830
take a date up to the top of a mountain

194
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,450
and sit on the platform thing you'll be

195
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,919
sitting in the same spot I accidentally

196
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,289
got kissed by someone and if you're

197
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,360
there take a picture and tweet at me

198
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:42,370
I'd say preferably of you guys kissing

199
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,930
but that's kind of weird I mean unless

200
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,090
you want to this last story isn't really

201
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,560
about flirting or dates but I think it's

202
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,969
kind of funny I was hanging out with an

203
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,979
ex friend and we were walking along

204
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:52,419
their colleges main strip it's a street

205
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,129
called Mill and it's got a bunch of

206
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:55,419
stores and restaurants along it and just

207
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,099
because I like how all these stories are

208
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,990
kind of connecting the restaurant first

209
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,969
kiss and I went to was on this trip too

210
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,180
we sat down at a bench outside a shop

211
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:04,960
and these two pastor bys go ah

212
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,969
relationshipgoals

213
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,620
as they walk into the shop we kind of

214
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:10,419
looked at each other and laughed and

215
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,550
just kept talking then a few minutes

216
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,710
later the same people left the store and

217
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,750
walked by us again and we're like so how

218
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,780

219
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:24,340

220
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:28,870
bit I just go he's gay their faces were

221
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:31,180

video don't overthink relationship stuff

223
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,560
for dates or kissing or whatever you're

224
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,300
overthinking if you like someone tell

225
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,360
them if you want to date someone ask

226
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,830
them if you want to kiss someone give

227
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,689
them more thinking time before you yank

228
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,340
their head at your face just be cool

229
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:47,169

00:00:01,154 --> 00:00:03,570
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:17,336
- What's up guys, welcome
to Day 1562 of the vlogs,

3
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:22,025
and today we have an awesome
surprise up our sleeves

4
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,982
for you and the kids.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,062
Speaking of kids, we just picked
them up from Mamaw's house.

6
00:00:26,062 --> 00:00:27,611
How was Tarzan?

7
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,503
- Good.
- [Bryce] Good.

8
00:00:28,503 --> 00:00:29,336
- [Clintus] You guys went 
to see Tarzan,

9
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,237
was it a really good movie?

10
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,404
Favorite part?

11
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:34,614
- It's really cool, like--

12
00:00:34,614 --> 00:00:35,601
- I don't wanna spoil it!

13
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:37,721
(laughing)

14
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,476
- It's really good when
he becomes Tarzan.

15
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:40,536
- When he becomes Tarzan.

16
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:42,109
When Tarzan becomes Tarzan.

17
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,350
- And in the previews,

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,984
you guys probably already
know this happened,

19
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,063
but when he fights gorillas.

20
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,372
- He fights gorillas.

21
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:52,840
Yeah, anything that's in a teaser

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,430
is not really a spoiler,

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,225
so he can say that.

24
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,427
Anyways, we just picked them up,

25
00:00:58,427 --> 00:00:59,773
we're leaving Mamaw's house

26
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:03,526
and we are heading 
in a general direction.

27
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:05,400
So here's a first hint,

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,567
we're gonna go 
shopping for something.

29
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:13,069
So I'm going to give
you three options.

30
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,539
You each get one guess.

31
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,320
Three options are, no, hang on.

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,031
I'm gonna give you three options,

33
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:21,252
and you guys get to give
us your one guess, alright?

34
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:23,252
First option: new house.

35
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,900
Two: new dirt bike.

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,103
Three: a new car.

37
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,686
Sierra, what guess do you have?

38
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:34,624
- House?

39
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:35,521
- Sierra says house.

40
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:36,579
Bryce, what do you say?

41
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:37,595
- Dirt bike.

42
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:38,428
- Dirt bike?

43
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:40,011
- I want the house,

44
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:46,198
but I think we're gonna
get the dirt bikes.

45
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:47,506
- Those were the two 
I was thinking in my head,

46
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:48,684
like, oh, it's either 
gonna be a house

47
00:01:48,684 --> 00:01:50,192
or the dirt bikes.

48
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,556
- I don't get a new car?

49
00:01:52,556 --> 00:01:55,746
- [Bryce] Well, yeah, 
it can't be a car.

50
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,050
- You said you're not 
gonna buy a new car

51
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,920
until we get a new house.

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,753
- Oh, I did say that.

53
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,808
I did say, ""Mommy's not
allowed to get a new car

54
00:02:01,808 --> 00:02:03,355
""until we get a new house.""

55
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,829
- [Bryce] So it's not the car.

56
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,986
- Aw, I just ruined, okay.

57
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:07,087
Alright, so it's between
the house and the dirt bike,

58
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:08,431
which is what you 
guys said, right?

59
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:10,883
You're voting house,
you're voting dirt bike?

60
00:02:10,883 --> 00:02:12,301
We shall see.

61
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,427
Alright, you guys 
ready to find out?

62
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,634
'Cause I mean, 
basically once we drive

63
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:21,160
up to this destination,
you'll know what it is.

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,834
So you ready?

65
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:23,669
- Yeah.

66
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:26,716
- Today, we are

67
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:29,196
going to go look at...

68
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:30,969
new dirt bikes!

69
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:32,007
- Okay.
- [Bryce] Okay.

70
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:34,819
(laughing)

71
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:35,652
- [Tiffany] For me!

72
00:02:35,652 --> 00:02:37,319
- [Clintus] For her!

73
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,125
- [Bryce] Quads?

74
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,958
- Just kidding.

75
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,129
(Clintus laughing)

76
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,188
- [Clintus] Actually we 
should, though.

77
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,063
While we're out looking,
might as well get you on some

78
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:45,959
and have you sit on them.

79
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,822
- [Bryce] I wanna do the houses.

80
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:47,966
- [Clintus] You wanna 
do the houses?

81
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,595
You said dirt bike, though.

82
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:50,902
- I know, because I knew--

83
00:02:50,902 --> 00:02:53,020
- [Clintus] Oh, you knew, 
you knew!

84
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,340
But you'd rather look at houses?

85
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,482
Well, that will come soon enough,

86
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,158
'cause I'm gonna call and we're
gonna get a realtor going.

87
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,026
We're gonna get 
the whole thing started.

88
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:00,382
- [Voiceover] Five years later.

89
00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:02,909
- So our first destination is
gonna be North Valley Honda.

90
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,823
It's the bike shop that I
bought my KX450 at last year.

91
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,289
Great people, they gave 
me a great price,

92
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,039
and so that's our first place.

93
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,301
And then after that,

94
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,013
because they only sell
Hondas and Kawasakis,

95
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:16,764
we'll probably go 
to another location

96
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,433
and look at like Suzukis,
Yamahas, KTMs, that sort of

97
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,514
thing and just kinda 
get a feel for the bikes,

98
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,143
for their sizes,

99
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:26,183
and get like a price on it.

100
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, you guys, they're closed!

101
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:31,403
They're closed on Sundays.

102
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,546
- [Tiffany] Fail.
- Dude, seriously,

103
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,648
when I was a kid,

104
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,789
and my dad can attest to this

105
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:35,971
if I call my dad right now,

106
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:38,336
dirt bike shops were
always open on Sundays

107
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:40,536
because everyone was
riding on Sundays, right?

108
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:42,002
So they'd go out to get
your last-minute gear,

109
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:43,226
you have to go 
get your, you know.

110
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:44,982
And it's Sunday,
everyone's off work.

111
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:46,569
And they would 
close on Mondays.

112
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:49,014
But dirt bike shops were
always closed on Mondays.

113
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,111
So I was like, oh,
we're good, it's Sunday,

114
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:51,111
no big deal.

115
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,377
They're closed!

116
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:54,610
Oh, no.

117
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,404
Bummer, dude.

118
00:03:58,089 --> 00:03:59,190
- [Tiffany] That one's definitely closed.

119
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,985
- [Clintus] That is
definitely closed, yeah.

120
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:02,415
- I think we just passed,

121
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:04,166
there's a couple shops on
Cave Creek here, right?

122
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,757
- Yeah, Cave Creek's a very
busy dirt bike-y place.

123
00:04:07,757 --> 00:04:08,899
That's why I came down here,

124
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,573
'cause I knew there were shops.

125
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:11,795
Cycle Gear's down there,

126
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,124
but that's a gear

127
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:14,590
to get gear.

128
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,863
So yeah, we'll go back.

129
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:16,696
And that shop was open,

130
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:18,108
there was dirt bikes
outside of the other shops.

131
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,329
We'll go to that other place.

132
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,247
But we're definitely 
gonna come back here,

133
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:24,063
'cause like I said, they gave
me a great deal on my bike

134
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,549
and something tells me they'll
give me another great deal

135
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,058
on their bike.

136
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,158
Of course a lot of you guys say

137
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,768
we need to get one 
of these four-seaters.

138
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:33,441
This is a two-seater, a
four-seater would be good.

139
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,274
Oh, these are single-seaters.

140
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,195
I didn't even know they
made single-seaters.

141
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,005
That's a single-seater, whoa!

142
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:38,839
I didn't know they made those.

143
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,119
Yeah, well, not if you
have one and I have one.

144
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,719
Yeah, a lot of people
want us to get a Razor,

145
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,345
and I want a Razor, I do.

146
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:45,240
I do want a Razor.

147
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,719
But we need a trailer 
to haul the Razor

148
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,612
and Tiffany doesn't really
want to haul a trailer.

149
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,845
So it means I need 
to get a toy hauler,

150
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:53,862
which means I need 
to get a bigger truck.

151
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:57,019
So this is all future stuff.

152
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:57,852
Alright, so there it is.

153
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:00,129
There's a YZ1, what was it, TTR.

154
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:00,962
TTR 110.
- [Voiceover] I like

155
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:01,795
how the blue looks.

156
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,507
- [Clintus] So that's a Yamaha.

157
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:04,860
- [Bryce] I think this is our size.

158
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,720
- [Clintus] That's what 
you shoulda got,

159
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,392
that's the first bike 
we shoulda got you.

160
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,559
That's a PW50.

161
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,535
That's what I should 
have gotten you guys.

162
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:11,395
- [Tiffany] That thing is so cute.

163
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,229
- [Clintus] I know.

164
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,062
- I can't lift it up.

165
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,033
I wanna do a wheelie.

166
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:14,866
- [Clintus] No.
- This feels smaller

167
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:15,969
than the one we have right now.

168
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:17,815
- [Clintus] It's lower, yeah.

169
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:18,962
But it's actually a bigger engine,

170
00:05:18,962 --> 00:05:19,905
it's 110.

171
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,216
Yours is a 65.

172
00:05:21,216 --> 00:05:22,966
So this is a TTR 125.

173
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,341
It's got an electric start.

174
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:27,610
- What's an electric start?

175
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,761
- [Clintus] You don't 
have to kick it.

176
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,594
You start it up.

177
00:05:30,594 --> 00:05:33,844
- Which size is the 
actual racers ride?

178
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:36,842
- [Clintus] 250s and 450s.

179
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:37,675
Down here.

180
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:40,743
- [Bryce] Those are 230s, 250s.

181
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:41,850
- [Clintus] Yep.

182
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,229
That's a WR, that's off-road.

183
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,239
This is a two-stroke.

184
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:48,493
This is what 
Uncle Austin wants to get.

185
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,786
Uncle Austin wants 
a 250 two-stroke.

186
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:51,619
- What about this?

187
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:52,452
- [Clintus] These are two-strokes.

188
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,285
125, 250.

189
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:54,231
- [Bryce] Where are the four-strokes?

190
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,582
- [Clintus] Four-strokes
are right here, yep.

191
00:05:55,582 --> 00:05:56,689
And see, look, come here.

192
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,522
You know how you know?

193
00:05:57,522 --> 00:05:58,673
Here's how you know, 
right there, bam.

194
00:05:58,673 --> 00:05:59,575
Look at that pipe.

195
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:00,435
See that pipe?
- [Bryce] Yeah.

196
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,583
- [Clintus] Those are two-strokes.

197
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,018
Four-strokes have the skinny pipe

198
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,494
and the big muffler in the back.

199
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,173
So that's like my bike, 450.

200
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,033
- [Bryce] Yeah, you can
tell the difference.

201
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,314
250, 450, you can tell
the size difference.

202
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:11,147
- [Sierra] Wait, that's 450s?

203
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:14,344
- [Clintus] Yeah, so these
bikes are kinda the same.

204
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:16,968
Two-stroke, four-stroke,
but they're the same class.

205
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:20,125
And then these are 250 and 125.

206
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,092
Oh, that's a WR, that's
an off-road edition.

207
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:24,884
They don't even have a 250--

208
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,648
- [Sierra] Can we get a Suzuki, or--

209
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:27,794
- [Clintus] These are Suzukis right here.

210
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:29,189
So here's your bike.

211
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,296
Oh, it's an 85.

212
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:33,166
Never mind, that's an 85.

213
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,166
And then these are 250s.

214
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:37,634
Four-strokes.

215
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:40,215
- [Sierra] Yeah, like,
it's not that (mumbles).

216
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:42,307
- [Clintus] And then we
got quads for Tiffany.

217
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:45,015
There's a 450, there's a 700.

218
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:48,242
700 Can-Am.

219
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,248
No, right here.

220
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,114
Oh, that's a 450 too.

221
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:52,390
- [Tiffany] You want a kid's one?

222
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,316
- [Clintus] That's a kid's one.

223
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:55,913
Yeah, that's basically
what Bryce was riding

224
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:57,801
at Brian's, right?

225
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,823
- It looked much cooler, though.

226
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:02,748
- [Clintus] Hey, there we go,
there's a 200 automatic there.

227
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,923
That's totally a kid's one,
but Mommy could ride that.

228
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,046
Hop on that real quick, see.

229
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:06,879
Yeah.

230
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:10,270
- Are we gonna get Mommy a...

231
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:12,621
Oh, Sierra!

232
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,590
Sierra, come here, look it!

233
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,998
Do you want to drive or do
you want to get in the back?

234
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,965
- [Clintus] Yes, it actually fits you!

235
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:18,921
That actually fits you.

236
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,754
- [Bryce] Yeah, Mommy!

237
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,730
- [Clintus] It looks smaller,

238
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,959
but it actually fits you,

239
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,955
because you're so tiny.

240
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,976
- This one I'll be able to handle.

241
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:28,809
- [Clintus] You could handle that.

242
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,080
- Very slow at first.

243
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,497
- [Clintus] 3600.

244
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:37,240
Oh, how you feeling, 
how you feeling?

245
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:41,475
You think you can handle that?
- Maybe.

246
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:43,360
- [Clintus] You want one?

247
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,878
- Can you buy me one, please?

248
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,562
- [Clintus] Let's see, your
birthday's already over,

249
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:47,395
Mother's Day's already over,

250
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,635
so I guess we need Christmas?

251
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,438
(laughs)

252
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:52,832
Hey, look at that, 
a double-seater!

253
00:07:52,832 --> 00:07:53,880
Bryce is in charge.

254
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,205
- Can I do the...

255
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:56,038
- [Clintus] That's the throttle.

256
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:57,945
- I got the backseat, though.

257
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,158
- [Clintus] Doesn't matter, it's off.

258
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:01,429
That thing is huge.

259
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,397
- He controls the quad,

260
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,230
but I get to have the backseat.

261
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,600
- We can drive this.

262
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,915
- [Clintus] What do you think, Sierra?

263
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,186
You like that?

264
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,665
It's got a kickstand.

265
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:10,897
No clutch, though.

266
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,208
There's no clutch.

267
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,098
So that's interesting.
- Can we shift, though?

268
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,495
- [Clintus] No, there's 
still a shifter.

269
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,972
The shifter's right there.

270
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:18,407
- But it twirls?

271
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,556
- [Clintus] You just let 
off the gas,

272
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:21,620
and you shift it, I guess.

273
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,453
- That's the kill button, right?

274
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:23,811
- [Clintus] Yep.

275
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,705
Bryce, that one has a clutch.

276
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,306
- What's this one, then?

277
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,047
There's two buttons on
here, I'm getting confused.

278
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,277
- [Clintus] So that's...

279
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,246
Oh, is it an electric start, too?

280
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,681
It looks like an electric start.

281
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,514
- [Sierra] And what's this?

282
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,442
- That's the killswitch.

283
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:36,958
Alright, so at this location,

284
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,626
they've got a TTR 110 for $2240,

285
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:44,159
and it's not an automatic,
but there's no clutch.

286
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,310
- [Sierra] You just shift.

287
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,581
- You just shift.

288
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,414
That's our first option.

289
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:48,247
- [Sierra] I want that.

290
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,080
- On to the next store.

291
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,214
Alrighty.

292
00:08:50,214 --> 00:08:51,812
Bellies are full of Mexican food.

293
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:54,395
Time for one more shop.

294
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,743
'Cause really, every other
store we looked at's closed.

295
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,899
I'm like, why are they 
closed on Sundays?

296
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:00,691
So we got one more 
shop to look at.

297
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:02,618
Hopefully they've got
a couple other brands,

298
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,657
'cause the first 
place only really had

299
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,200
the Yamaha in their size.

300
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,124
They carry Suzuki, but they
didn't have any in their size.

301
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:09,926
So I'm hoping that Honda
and Kawasakis are here.

302
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:10,759
We'll see.

303
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,707
Alright, so they've 
got all the brands.

304
00:09:13,707 --> 00:09:16,741
Hondas, Kawasakis, 
Yamahas, Suzukis.

305
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,574
You're right, 
they don't have KTM.

306
00:09:17,574 --> 00:09:18,442
- They don't have KTM.

307
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,344
- [Clintus] At least
they're not over here.

308
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:20,615
There's some more on
the other side, he said.

309
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,213
So that's the 110.

310
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,753
What do you think, you think
Sierra's too big for that?

311
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:25,817
- My legs are long.

312
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,046
- [Clintus] Your legs are long, I know.

313
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,235
But as far as like power-wise,

314
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,710
I know that's the right 
size bike for you,

315
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,980
as far as power.

316
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,334
But yeah, I'm worried
that you're too tall.

317
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,588
Put your right leg up,

318
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:36,762
put your right leg up.

319
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:37,910
- [Bryce] This is my size.

320
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,743
- [Clintus] Yeah, see, you're almost

321
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,910
too tall for that, Sierra.

322
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,432
That's the right size for
you, Bryce, you think?

323
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:46,320
Little 70? (laughs)

324
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,153
Pee wee bike.

325
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,792
That's like the last 
red bike you had.

326
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,625
Same size.

327
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,441
They don't have any Kawasaki 110s.

328
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,325
They've got this 
two-stroke 100, though.

329
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,158
And then there's 85.

330
00:09:57,158 --> 00:10:00,096
Those are still too big for you.

331
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,355
- This is my new car, guys.

332
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:04,157
- [Clintus] It's almost
like the Batmobile.

333
00:10:04,157 --> 00:10:07,230
It's kinda like the Batmobile.

334
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,980
That's your new ride?

335
00:10:10,024 --> 00:10:11,284
- This is cool.

336
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:12,117
- It's a new car, right?

337
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:13,425
- [Clintus] It's a good fit for you.

338
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:15,486
- Basically a car.

339
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,570
This is my next car, guys.

340
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,403
- [Clintus] What do you guys think?

341
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:19,784
Should we ditch the 
name brand stuff

342
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,490
and just go with 
these old pit bikes?

343
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,213
That an automatic, Bryce?

344
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:25,046
- [Bryce] I guess, yeah.

345
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:26,149
- [Clintus] I don't know,
but there's a shifter.

346
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,420
There's no clutch, though.

347
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,054
So you just shift 
it without a clutch.

348
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:32,308
I just feel like it's a 50, right?

349
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,622
It's a small engine, 
like I feel like you

350
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,019
would just grow out of it.

351
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,482
You would just grow 
out of it so fast.

352
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:38,587
It's a big bike, though.

353
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,899
I mean, it's got suspension for me.

354
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,991
I could put my butt on there.

355
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,592
Wow, guys, I'm mega-bummed,

356
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,107
like, what a fail.

357
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:46,911
We were totally excited to
go looking for dirt bikes

358
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,424
and surprise the kids,
and like, A, it's Sunday

359
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,145
and almost all the 
stores are closed,

360
00:10:51,145 --> 00:10:52,787
and B, the two stores we went to

361
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,713
literally only had a Yamaha.

362
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,546
That's all they had,

363
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:56,597
which I'm not saying
anything against Yamaha,

364
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:59,136
but I kinda wanted to have
the kids sit on each one,

365
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,693
get a feel for 
which one's like, taller,

366
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,947
which one, the seat 
feels better, right?

367
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:04,709
Get some competition with
the prices and whatnot.

368
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,963
And like, nothing.

369
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:09,466
So we definitely 
have to come back.

370
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,023
We definitely have 
to go during the week

371
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,007
when all the 
other shops are open.

372
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,235
I definitely want to
check out North Valley,

373
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:14,998
'cause North Valley's gonna
have Kawasakis and Hondas,

374
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,008
which are my two leading
brands that I want the kids

375
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,486
to possibly get.

376
00:11:18,486 --> 00:11:20,538
It would be nice if 
we all rode Kawasakis,

377
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,793
but Hondas are a close second.

378
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:23,626
So, yeah.

379
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,171
Sorry, guys.

380
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,568
Fail dirt bike shopping.

381
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:27,401
(blows raspberry)

382
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,113
Alright, guys, so we
made our way back home.

383
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:30,672
Tiff and I kinda talked a little bit,

384
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:34,276
and we'll probably have to
wait 'til after our trip,

385
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,915
which we're going 
on a trip this week,

386
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:37,227
in case you didn't know.

387
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:38,087
I kinda hinted at that.

388
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,399
We have an action-packed week,

389
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,300
you guys don't want to miss it.

390
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,283
I mean, like, seriously.

391
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,116
It's gonna be awesome.

392
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:43,127
I've never been to this place.

393
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:44,710
But anyways,

394
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,168
we'll have to wait 'til we
come back after our trip

395
00:11:47,168 --> 00:11:49,544
to go back and look 
at the dirt bikes,

396
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,814
but I'm feeling pretty good.

397
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:52,083
The research I've done,

398
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,916
like I said, it's gonna be

399
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:53,854
between the Kawasaki 
and the Honda.

400
00:11:53,854 --> 00:11:56,475
I just want the kids 
to sit on them first.

401
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,524
So after our trip,

402
00:11:58,524 --> 00:11:59,962
stay tuned.

403
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,299
New dirt bike for 
one of these kids.

404
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,816
I don't know which one yet.

405
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:06,029
I'll buy it and then
whoever's my favorite,

406
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:06,972
I'll give them the bike.

407
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,557
Anyways,

408
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:09,390
I'm joking, by the way.

409
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,300
I don't have a favorite,
I don't have favorites.

410
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,775
We're gonna play some
Magic: The Gathering.

411
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:12,679
These kids are super excited,

412
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,694
I built their decks yesterday,

413
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:15,499
and that's all that's 
been on their mind,

414
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,137
other than the dirt bike,

415
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:17,970
is to play.

416
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,118
So we've got our decks shuffled,

417
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:23,088
and our seven cards dealt.

418
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:23,921
So here we go.

419
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:25,056
Magic: The Gathering.

420
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:27,356
Alright, we're well into the game.

421
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:29,570
And I just told the kids,
put their hands on the table

422
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,297
so that I can kinda 
see what they have

423
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,854
and kinda walk them through
the different steps,

424
00:12:32,854 --> 00:12:34,084
'cause there's a lot to this game.

425
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,560
There's sorcery, 
there's creatures,

426
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,022
there's enchantments, 
there's instants.

427
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,152
So it's one of those things
where they're learning.

428
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:42,425
They're learning.

429
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:43,909
So far, so good?

430
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:45,668
What do you think?

431
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,429
You getting bored yet?

432
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,477
It's a slow game.

433
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,510
- We're in the learning part,

434
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,445
so.

435
00:12:52,445 --> 00:12:53,347
- [Clintus] It's like school.

436
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:54,741
You're like, meh, school.

437
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,422
- And this is one 
of my creatures.

438
00:12:56,422 --> 00:12:57,364
- That's one of your creatures.

439
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,129
That's a dried cherry, don't eat it.

440
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:01,792
Alright, so after the first round,

441
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,625
Bryce took out Sierra.

442
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:05,951
So you eliminated Sierra,

443
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,181
and then I eliminated Bryce.

444
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,983
And the reason why I
eliminated Bryce is why?

445
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:09,966
- I made a mistake,

446
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:14,766
so I tapped all three of these cards

447
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:16,281
and I did two damage to Sierra,

448
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:17,223
so that knocked her out,

449
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:19,435
then I did three damage to you.

450
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:20,606
- [Clintus] But, because you tapped

451
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,958
all your creatures, what?

452
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,024
- I couldn't block,

453
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,632
so when he has a creature
that I could do six--

454
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:29,486
- He only had six life,
I had four creatures out

455
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:32,272
and three of them 
could do enough damage

456
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:33,257
to kill him out,

457
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,693
let alone all of them together.

458
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:36,167
So the lesson he learned

459
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,299
was don't attack 
with all your creatures

460
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:39,322
when you have that low of life,

461
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:40,757
'cause you have 
nothing to block with.

462
00:13:40,757 --> 00:13:43,505
And what are you doing
while we're playing Magic?

463
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:44,816
- This.

464
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:45,761
- [Clintus] You're still
playing Best Fiends.

465
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:46,720
- Yeah, it's so addicting.

466
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,878
- [Clintus] What level are you on?

467
00:13:47,878 --> 00:13:49,968
- Well, I got stuck, like at 47,

468
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,900
then you have to 
do this special thing

469
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,607
that has like 20 things within it.

470
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:55,922
But it's addicting.

471
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:56,839
- Yeah, 47?

472
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,459
Alright, so after two games,

473
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,376
I won both.

474
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,315
- Obviously.

475
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:03,669
- Well, no, I mean,

476
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,144
the first game you had me down

477
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,661
to like, nine?

478
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:07,645
I was down low,

479
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,902
but the real 
question is this, okay?

480
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:10,735
And honestly.

481
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:13,347
No b.s., you two, okay?

482
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:14,248
Did you like the game

483
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:16,381
and do you wanna play it again?

484
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,303
- [Bryce] Yes.
- Yes.

485
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,025
- Yes, both of you?

486
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,646
- Can we do tournaments,
like at that one place?

487
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,205
- Well, once you know how to play,

488
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:26,400
once I know that
you can play by yourself,

489
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,465
and I don't have
to give you any help,

490
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:28,298
then you can play tournaments.

491
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:29,169
- Yeah, I meant that,

492
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,727
not like right now.

493
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:31,560
- You, I was worried, though.

494
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,349
It felt like you were getting bored.

495
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,029
Is it because that last
game was just really slow?

496
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:36,631
- Yeah, like we didn't get any land

497
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:38,187
so we can put anything--

498
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:39,292
- The way Magic works, guys,

499
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,850
is you draw seven cards,

500
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,916
you have seven 
cards in your hand,

501
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,515
and if you don't 
have any lands,

502
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,626
you can't do anything.

503
00:14:44,626 --> 00:14:45,486
And then once you have lands,

504
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:46,554
you have to have things to do,

505
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,742
and Bryce wasn't 
getting any creatures.

506
00:14:47,742 --> 00:14:48,575
That was your other problem.

507
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,683
You had all spells and instances.

508
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,433
- So what I was doing

509
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,613
was I was getting no land,

510
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,663
but I was getting a
whole lot of creatures.

511
00:14:59,663 --> 00:15:01,196
Then I got a whole bunch of land--

512
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:03,616
- And no creatures.
- [Bryce] And no creatures.

513
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,911
I got a whole bunch of lands,
put the creatures down--

514
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:06,977
- And Sierra, you, same thing.

515
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:08,084
You were getting no creatures, right?

516
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,026
And when you did get one,

517
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:12,439
we would attack 
and you'd lose them all.

518
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,568
Anyway, so you 
guys are good, then?

519
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:14,741
- Yeah, I like it.

520
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:15,970
- Alright, cool, I'm excited.

521
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,049
They just need more practice.

522
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,916
It's a game that takes
time to learn the skill

523
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:20,816
and what all the things do

524
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,003
and when to use them.

525
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,397
But even just 
in that second game,

526
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:24,748
you guys were definitely
picking things up.

527
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:25,998
So I'm excited.

528
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:29,504
Well, guys, this is the way
we're gonna end the vlog,

529
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:30,446
hope you enjoyed it.

530
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,209
Unfortunately, like I said,

531
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,218
kind of epic fail when it
came to going and looking

532
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:35,051
at dirt bikes today,

533
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,760
but like I said,

534
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,525
when we get back 
from our trip this week,

535
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,797
we'll definitely go back out,

536
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,378
hit up a couple more shops
that were closed today,

537
00:15:42,378 --> 00:15:44,016
and we will make 
our final decision

538
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,683
on a new dirt bike 
for the kids.

539
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:49,851
This is our 
last-ditch effort, really.

540
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:52,720
We buy this new bike, 
a new four-stroke,

541
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,222
and if they don't 
get the confidence,

542
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:56,943
they don't feel like riding,

543
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,776
it might be the last dirt
bike the kids ever own.

544
00:15:58,776 --> 00:16:01,413
But, speaking of 
dirt bikes, tomorrow

545
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,580
Mike Junior Swag hit us up

546
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:05,840
and wants to go 
ride in the morning,

547
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,864
so I'm gonna 
go riding with them

548
00:16:06,864 --> 00:16:08,543
in the morning bright and early,

549
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:10,595
so stay tuned tomorrow, 
dirt bike video.

550
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,000
Whoo, vlog on.

[Music]

10
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:32,510
am a believer in the perfectibility of

11

human beings

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,000
we are our best selves the possibilities

13
00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:40,580
are endless

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,610
at the circle there isn't a problem that

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:47,510
we cannot solve we can cure any disease

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,610
and we can and hunger without secrets

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:52,910
without the hoarding of knowledge and

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:56,300
information we can finally realize our

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,380
potential circulars if you like to share

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,380
[Music]

21
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:09,020
we will see it all

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:13,240
if it happens we'll know

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:15,840
imagine the human rights implications

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,259
there needs to be accountability

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,049
what is this the circle has a power to

26
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,100
changed everything so we are lines that

27
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,490

Its so important to me to make sure my kids have clean family/kid friendly safe content to watch, so I can assure you that you'll never see us make videos that are teaching anything but good.  I always try to teach positive lessons in my videos.  We hope you enjoy watching our videos.

more nuanced take on the inner workings

least to embrace emotions rather than

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,520
urged to master them the film tells the

33
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,859
story of the 11-year old Riley as she

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,130
navigates a move across the country and

35
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:43,210
more centrally how five emotions joy the

leader sadness fear disgust and anger

37
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,229
balance the control of her mind from a

mission control like headquarters in

40
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:55,549
moments colored by one of the five

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,070
emotions which are sent during sleep to

42
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:00,469
a vast archive of long-term memories

43
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,630
very rarely an experience is so

44
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:05,149
formative that it creates a core memory

45
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,850
which goes on to form the basis of

46
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,850
Riley's personality imagined as theme

47
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,830
park islands when joy and sadness are

48
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,780
accidentally ejected from head

49
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,550
the film chronicles their cathartic

50
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,830
journey through several other mental

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,930
regions including Imaginationland a

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,660
dream production company that looks like

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,120
the Paramount lot abstract thought and a

54
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,760
subconscious jail the catharsis comes

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,340
when joy realizes that sadness is not

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,860
only useful but essential perhaps even

57
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,750
more essential than she is - Riley's

58
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,510
harmonious mental functioning and

59
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,210
overall happiness the film itself and

60
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,390
its message to embrace sadness to feel

61
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,000
what needs feeling is surely a token of

62
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,520
progress against our long-standing

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,010
emotional anxiety but is this model of

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,350
the mind and its emotions an accurate

65
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,540
one inside out basis its theory of

66
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,940
emotions in large part on the work of

67
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,640
Paul Ekman and influential scientists in

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,250
the psychology of emotion Eckman posits

69
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,740
that there are seven basic emotions with

70
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,780
Universal facial signals the ones

71
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,870
featured in the film plus two that were

72
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,450
cut surprise and contempt these basic

73
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,640
emotions are ubiquitous the world over

74
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,010
Ahmed says and can be read on the faces

75
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,260
of anyone whether that's by an astute

76
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,380
listener or facial recognition software

77
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,400
like those Eggman has helped develop

78
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,590
controversially for security and

79
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,150
marketing mrs. Eckman and other

80
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,580
consultants on the film have praised

81
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,100
inside-out for providing a model for

82
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,010
kids that is engaging as well as

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,110
scientifically sound but though Ekman's

84
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,840
model may be the dominant one in the

85
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,239
psychology of emotion right now it's by

86
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,760
no means the only indeed the field is a

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,670
far more fractious one than the film

88
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,380
scientific consultants LED on inside out

89
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,540
seems to suggest that a child's

90
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,330
experiences will be defined by whichever

91
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,610
emotion is at the helm what's more that

92
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:01,130
overall personality determined by

93
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,640
colored core memories has an emotional

94
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:07,070
driver this model stands opposite to the

95
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,230
key insights of psychoanalysis for

96
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,140
example which hold that emotions can be

97
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,840
transferred transformed or distorted

98
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,090
expressions of unconscious ideas and

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,359
repressed experiences in other words

100
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,010
feelings of sadness or joy or fear are

101
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:23,650
free

102
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,870
quickly far removed from their causes

103
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,360
understanding them as specific entities

104
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,250
is troublesome because they're often not

105
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,140
what they seem to be which is to say

106
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,180
that understanding emotion as the driver

107
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,940
and not the expression of ideas and

108
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,010
experience may ignore underlying causes

109
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,230
indeed the idea that emotions or

110
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,750
memories can be separate or discrete in

111
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,640
any way is a dubious one the film itself

112
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,410
begins to challenge this at the end when

113
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,870
the control panel in headquarters is

114
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,460
expanded to fit all the emotions and

115
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
when the memory orbs start to reflect

116
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,070
mixed experience but a sense that

117
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,440
experience can be quantified pervades

118
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,420
the film and like anything that may

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,090
reflect more about our culture at the

120
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,280
moment than the science itself for joy

121
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,290
and sadness the scariest place in the

122
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,200
film isn't the subconscious prison that

123
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,360
houses Riley's worst fears but a giant

124
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,880
pit in the center of Riley's mind where

125
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,000
memories are forgotten forever without

126
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,490
any hope of recall an increasingly

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,220
data-driven culture where more data

128
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,700
equals more truth the greatest anxiety

129
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,010
of all is the loss of information and

130
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,560
the headquarters of Riley's mind does

131
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,260
feel a bit managerial with its control

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,690
panel and user manuals and Riley a bit

133
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,030
like an automaton controlled by a highly

134
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,740
sophisticated technocratic operation the

135
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,930
decision-making process is a bit wonky

136
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,780
too since the latest neuroscience tells

137
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,670
us that the frontal lobe in acts kind of

138
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,890
executive function that mediates between

139
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,750
the emotions in the limbic system and

140
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,280
higher cognitive functions like

141
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,070
reflection and critical thinking

142
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,960
obviously not always in favour of the

143
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,060
latter maybe at this point you're saying

144
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,450
the same thing as the voice in my own

145
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,580
it's a kids movie it's a comedy that's

146
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,620
very true and the director Pete docter

147
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,170
has never held this film up as an

148
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,390
academic or therapeutic tool he admits

149
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,550
the need for poetic and comedic license

150
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,080
adding an executive function like the

151
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,360
kind I just mentioned for example would

152
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,190
no doubt make the film too complex as

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,590
with any number of other things like the

154
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,080
two basic emotions he left out or any

155
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,510
other emotion I don't think his dramatic

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,610
instincts can be questioned here under

157
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,250
the premises of the emotional model that

158
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,180
inside out presents the narrative

159
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,940
unfolds with

160
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,949
grace subtlety and intense poignancy

161
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,259
I'll leave the formal critique to

162
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:44,199
someone else but there is no doubt that

163
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:46,539
this is masterful filmmaking I had the

164
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,030
tears to prove it but it does raise

165
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,139
questions about the effect of popular

166
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,900
models of the mind

167
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,080
Pixar tells stories so mythic and

168
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,479
archetypal and so well that it's all but

169
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,240
impossible not to internalize some of

170
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,590
their elements especially for kids if

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,080
the result is that children learn

172
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,009
earlier and better why it's important to

173
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,830
accept and expect sadness then I think

174
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,590
it's unquestionably a good thing but

175
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,470
sadness and joy and fear and disgust and

176
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,199
anger are not discrete things or

177
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:23,080
self-contained or even fully internal

178
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,740
neither our personality traits or for

179
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,780
that matter personalities any model of

180
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,000
emotion is going to reflect a split

181
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,340
between biology and culture between

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,500
neuroscience and theoretical

183
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,449
psychoanalysis don't let anyone tell you

184
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,010
that that debate has been decided one

185
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,080
way or the other there are as many

186
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,630
emotional theories as there are

187
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,090
emotional psychologists what's

188
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,039
interesting and ironic about inside out

189
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,190
is that Riley may come off as a bit

190
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:53,320
robotic but a more complex and complete

191
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,530
framework for the inner workings of the

192
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,590
mind can be found in joy herself a

193
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:02,229
character who questions and reflects who

194
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,599
turns inward not to another smaller

195
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,580
headquarters but a cauldron of

196
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,490
indistinct compounds of feeling

197
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,880
influenced by chemistry situation and

198
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,789
other people inside out may not be

199
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,979
perfectly accurate but the film inspires

200
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,039
something more important than that

201
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:23,940
something that doesn't require

202
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,940
scientific exactness

203
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:34,180
emotional intelligence it is a sunny day

204
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,410
us right now hi everybody thanks for

205
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,570
watching

206
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,710
I love Pixar generally but I love this

207
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,690
movie just because it gives you so much

208
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,039
to dig into and explore and I had a lot

209
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,030
of fun making this and putting this

210
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,520
together

211
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,930
if you think that the nerd writer and

212
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,280
what I'm doing here is something that

213
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,620
you're not seeing elsewhere on on

214
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,910
YouTube you can pledge a little to my

215
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,870
channel by clicking here and going to my

216
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,030
patreon it's what funds this project and

217
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,560
helps me improve the quality there's so

218
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,780
much more I want to do this more series

219
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,910
that I'm going to be introducing soon

220
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,440
and the funding is what makes it

221
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,850
possible I mean that that's the unique

222
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,810
relationship between you and me there's

223
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,640
nothing in between us

224
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,550
and what you give me the money you give

225
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,010
me helps me to make this project better

226
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,140
and more in-depth and I hope that you

227
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,610
trust that I will do that by you know by

228
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,770

what's up you guys it's Griffin and

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome back to my channel for today's

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,810
video I have a video that I've been

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,140
wanting to film for like four days

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,719
straight

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,460

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,900
iPhone and how I edit my Instagram

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,040
pictures because I feel like I just have

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,540
to include that because you guys are

10
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,220
always so curious about it my background

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,260
is actually something that I had one of

12
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,660
you guys tweet to me because I saw like

13
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,800
a mini form of it on tumblr and I was

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,789
like in love with it and I tweeted it

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,590
out the picture now it's like this

16
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,820
anyone have any pictures similar to this

17
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,410
and someone was like I have the full

18
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,240
version I'll send it to you when I open

19
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,710
it I obviously have like some of these

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,270
apps I'm not going to explain because

21
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,040
they're just like the apps that come on

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,780
the iPhone or it's like an app -

23
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,700
everyone knows I have the mail app which

24
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,649
is the mail app you know and then I have

25
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,170
my music app which I wouldn't really use

26
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,090
often I have to Harlem shake because I

27
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,620
use that as my alarm because it didn't

28
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,989
ohing song that wakes me up and then I

29
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,030
have my Google Calendar which basically

30
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,399
has all of my work in it all of my

31
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,110
calendar dates and everything definitely

32
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,100
been using Google Calendar more because

33
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,930
I feel like it's a little bit more

34
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,190
organized than your regular calendar I

35
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,660
don't know I feel like Google's just a

36
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,789
little bit ahead of things when it comes

37
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,199
to like organization than Apple is and

38
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,390
then I have my photos and I know you

39
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,770
guys are always super into what is in my

40
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,810
camera roll so I'll just scroll through

41
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,430
for a minute I have some pictures I took

42
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,979
today I have makeup I have the twelve

43
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,070
screening I went to my birthday party

44
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,299
when I was in Arizona and that's about

45
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,860
it I don't have a bunch of my camera

46
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,210
roll because I just got this phone like

47
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,710
recently and that's why I'm doing the

48
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,970
what's on my iPhone because I figured

49
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,590
you guys would like to see like what I

50
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,090
have on my new phone I kind of like

51
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,680
switched things up a little bit I have

52
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,030
the camera app which obviously you know

53
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
what that does I have the videos app and

54
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,610
I don't think I have yeah I don't have

55
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,740
any videos on it and then I have the

56
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,049
clock which I only have a few clock and

57
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,520
then for alarm guys look at this long

58
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,810
list of alarms and they're all like five

59
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,180
or ten minutes apart from each other

60
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,700
because I never wake up for my first

61
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,439
alarm so um it starts around 4 a.m.

62
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,110
because sometimes I've early call times

63
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,380
but generally I wake up at either like

64
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,869
752 8:10 somewhere between there or 855

65
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,090
- 905 I have my personal calendar on the

66
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,590
app calendar just because I feel like

67
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,909
that one's a little bit it's not as like

68
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,500
scheduled and I'll just put in like

69
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,939
bigger things like my friends birthdays

70
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,200
or like things like that that I need to

71
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,780
remember it I'll put that in that

72
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
calendar

73
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,680
and then I have Safari and I have my

74
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,850
phone on airplane mode so I'm not

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,380
getting text in the middle of this and

76
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,790
it's not like super glitchy I guess the

77
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,959
last thing I'm Psalm is YouTube but I

78
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,880
have the app for that so I don't know

79
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
why I was there and then I have maps I

80
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,600
just use this when Google Maps isn't

81
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,100
working and then I have my weather app

82
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,870
and I never really checked that if I

83
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,069
ever look up the weather ice for some

84
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,040
reason instead of going to the weather

85
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,959
app I just go to like weather calm on my

86
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,340
Safari then I have the App Store and

87
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,470
then I have my notes which I don't

88
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,420
really do a ton in I just kind of write

89
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,040
down random video ideas or if I'm like

90
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,360
on the go and I'm trying to plan a video

91
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
like I'm in the car somewhere and

92
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,450
someone else is driving then I have the

93
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,580
iTunes Store which if I don't use iTunes

94
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,290
I don't really use iTunes store I have

95
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,180
fine friends but I don't really use that

96
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,459
either there's I don't use a lot of like

97
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,410
the apps on here um but we're about to

98
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,790
get into my folders which is mostly the

99
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,680
apps that I use the first thing that I

100
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,300
have in here is facetune and the last

101
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,100
picture I was editing was of me and

102
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,720
Carrington and I obviously have some

103
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,790
acne so I'm not gonna like sit there and

104
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,560
leave my acne like hanging out I don't

105
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,209
like when my happy visible in pictures I

106
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,040
don't care if like it's visible in video

107
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,680
or like anything like that I edit my

108
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,620
pimples out sue me so what I do to edit

109
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,690
on facetune for pimples eye patch so I

110
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,850
grab like a different spot on my skin

111
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,110
and I like cover it and like look at the

112
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,150
difference that makes it works so well

113
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,799
or I take the smoothing option and I

114
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,180
just smooth it out like that so it's

115
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,150
like it's still there it's just like

116
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,799
smooth and then sometimes I like to

117
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,570
bring out the detail of my eyes so I

118
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,000
click the detail option and I just

119
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,829
circle it once with my finger and the

120
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,750
before and after is like insane with

121
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,820
that I have blue eyes so you can see

122
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,680
details when like the Sun is in my eyes

123
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,299
or it's really nice lighting you can see

124
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,769
the details I don't really do too much

125
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,660
editing and I don't like to go too heavy

126
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,340
because I obviously want to look natural

127
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,620
and I don't want to look like I'm a

128
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,630
Barbie and then I go into visco and this

129
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,510
is basically where I will show you guys

130
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,280
the editing portion of my Instagram

131
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,930
pictures I only use those two apps so

132
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
use facetune to edit out any like

133
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,890
impurities if I have any and then I use

134
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,090
vsco to actually edit the picture we'll

135
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,290
use that same picture that I took with

136
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,959
kherington that I was showing you guys

137
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,820
in the face to nap so we're going to

138
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,500
edit that one for you guys here as a

139
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,160
demo the filter that I've been using

140
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,599
lately is c7 but sometimes it makes your

141
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,340
skin look really Orange if you're in

142
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,269
like a weird light or anything like that

143
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,039
so I

144
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,530
- and this one is that's not the case

145
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,270
but if it is I go to temperature and I

146
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,949
turn it down one or two this one's not

147
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,020
bad so I'm gonna leave the temperature

148
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,870
as is and then I generally crop it as a

149
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,910
square crop because I don't like having

150
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,889
my pictures as like the horizontal or

151
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,539
vertical versions of the pictures so I

152
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,039
try to crop them all square unless

153
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,050
they're a picture that looks better

154
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,880
full but that's really all I do we can

155
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,289
look at a few pictures and see anything

156
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,910
that I've done with these yeah this one

157
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:47,229
just has a c7 preset it was pretty

158
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,669
orange and I was thinking about taking

159
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,229
the temperature down and same with this

160
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,909
one I took the temperature down a little

161
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,430
bit like with these ones where it's all

162
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:55,900
blue sometimes I'll add temperature just

163
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,430
so that it fits with the rest of the

164
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,080
pictures I pretty much just try to make

165
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,880
all the pictures flow together and have

166
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,500
some similar color similarities like

167
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,210
between all of them which can be a

168
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,740
little bit tedious sometimes but it's

169
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,840
definitely worth it if you like having a

170
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,250
really organized Instagram feed next is

171
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,750
PayPal which I don't really feel the

172
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,130
need to go into and then I have the

173
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,289
SoulCycle app which I don't even think

174
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,270
I'm logged into this one um just because

175
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,770
I just got the new phone and I have it

176
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,300
done SoulCycle cents and then I have the

177
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,400
BuzzFeed app which is my favorite app

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,740
ever I go on here all the time I go to

179
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,330
the news section but I also really love

180
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,120
going to the quiz section of the app

181
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,229
because I love taking quizzes and I'm

182
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,400
always sending quizzes to my friend

183
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,719

185
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:35,979

00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,129
this one yet so let's hope that I don't

216
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,590
have to use it I have the Wells Fargo

217
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,240
app which I just used that to check like

218
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,650
my balances and make sure I'm staying

219
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,139
within my budget because I like to

220
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,939
budget myself and then I have uber and I

221
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,279
don't really over a lot of places so

222
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,479
anytime that I have to leave and I know

223
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,979
I'm going to come back home and it's

224
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,060
gonna be like 10:00 at night by the time

225
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:45,620
I get home and there's gonna be no

226
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,360
street parking that's when only work

227
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,210
then I have crowdfire which tells me

228
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,310
Twitter and Instagram analytics then I

229
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,990
have iBooks which I only really use to

230
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,749
put scripts in I don't really use it for

231
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:58,400
the books aspect of things but oh well I

232
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,020
have the health app which I only check

233
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,789
every once in awhile for like the steps

234
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,879
part of it I don't ever use a podcast

235
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,409
compass or voice memos I sometimes use

236
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,759
the news then I post mates which I

237
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,539
rarely use because they always mess up

238
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,699
my orders

239
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,500
um and then I have this home app which

240
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,120
I've actually never used before and I've

241
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,919
drawer - which I use more than post

242
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,389
mates because they don't mess up my

243
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,560
order they always get it right

244
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,150
I don't know I'm always impressed with

245
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,069
them and they have they've different

246
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,810
options and post me next I have Spotify

247
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:25,550
and I make playlists every once in a

248
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,680
while I can't remember the last time I

249
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,000
made a playlist um but I wanted to make

250
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,050
another one I feel like I there are

251
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,460
songs that I've heard recently that

252
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,719
other people haven't heard or haven't

253
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,159
been introduced to other people so I

254
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,870
thought it'd be fun to make one like new

255
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:38,120
music and like share with you guys I

256
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,830
like going onto the Browse section and

257
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,449
looking at the discover weekly or like

258
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,129
the new music Friday those are my two

259
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,649
favorite playlists at Spotify mix

260
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,689
because I have the Yelp act which I use

261
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,759
to find food generally like if I'm in an

262
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,649
area that I don't know - well I can use

263
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,180
it to find food and near me then I have

264
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,949
the foodie app which basically you just

265
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,960
post everything that you're eating on

266
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,580
there which is perfect for food lovers

267
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,199
and I have insta track which you can

268
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,969
check like the exact amount of followers

269
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,949
that you have and then I have layout

270
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:05,870
which I use every once in a while then I

271
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,039
have my Oh IQ it's supposed to track all

272
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,569
your trips and you're supposed to be

273
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,009
able to write them off so you can like

274
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,330
save money in your taxes but I always

275
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:12,260
forget to use it so it's kind of

276
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,000
pointless and

277
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,220
I have Google Maps which I just used to

278
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,960
get around I have socialblade and I am

279
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,150
always on social blade you can check

280
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,370
your YouTube analytics and Instagram

281
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,160
analytics then I have a studio YouTube

282
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,140
app that is just for like the backend

283
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,110
stuff so I can see analytics on YouTube

284
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,300
and I can respond to comments easily on

285
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,979
it then I have Netflix which you guys

286
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,810
know I always love a good netflix and

287
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,790
chill' that was such a bad joke I have

288
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,860
iMovie and I never really use it to edit

289
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:42,020
on my phone I have Amazon yeah so the

290
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,030
last thing I ordered on Amazon was socks

291
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,440
because I ran out of thoughts and I

292
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,270
don't know where any of mine are and I

293
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,950
have the you know app I you know every

294
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,290
once in a while so make sure you go

295
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:52,610
follow me on there I have my bitmoji app

296
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,530
which i think is fun but I don't really

297
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,960
use often I only have it on my phone so

298
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,840
I can connect it to snapchat and then I

299
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,760
have the Ben Moe Act which like I said I

300
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,200
use that mostly for like paying other

301
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,880
people like I pay my acting instructor

302
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,340
or my therapist or things like that I

303
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,590
sign easy which helps me sign contracts

304
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,120
I have prime now which is amazing if you

305
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,640

306
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,080
one to two hour free delivery depending

307
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,670
on like where you live they don't have

308
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,530
everything that they have on Amazon on

309
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,000
here but they have a lot of stuff on

310
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,370
here then I have Facebook which I don't

311
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,170
use super often but I've been trying to

312
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,520
get into it more you guys have any ideas

313
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,780

315
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,720

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,580
homegirl doesn't know what to post then

317
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,020
I have this app and it's a game and it's

318
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,260
called like rolling or something like

319
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,700
that

320
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,620
although I can't get past level 2 I

321
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,390
haven't played in a long time I died but

322
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,580
oh well and then I have whatsapp but I

323
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,230
don't ever use that I had it on my phone

324
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,270
from when I was filming royal crush

325
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,500
because sometimes on the ship you didn't

326
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,720
have like the best service so we would

327
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,130
used that I have boomerang which I'm

328
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,350
sure all of you guys are aware of it

329
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,910
makes fun little gifts like I just made

330
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,380
that little gift I probably would never

331
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,120
post that ones and I have an app called

332
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,250
rep luhan's and that connects me with

333
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,720
different brands that i like so if i

334
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,340
wanted to work with canon and they were

335
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,200
on the red fluence app i could contact

336
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,090
them through there then I have Pinterest

337
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,370
I just basically get like beauty hacks

338
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,230
on this and I have a Sudoku app because

339
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,550
I got to sodoku for a while but I

340
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,089
haven't played it in like forever so

341
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,160
maybe I should delete it then I

342
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,689
Getty Images and I checked Getty Images

343
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,309
every once in a while I really only

344
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:19,529
check it whenever I walk red carpets and

345
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:22,439
I want to see pictures from that event I

346
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:24,480
have the engage app with Twitter and I

347
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,769
don't check that but it basically gives

348
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,779
you all the analytics you would ever

349
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,040
need and then I have the Etsy app a lot

350
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,649
of people asked where I got my Halloween

351
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,720
costume from and I got it on Etsy but se

352
00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,240
basically just has all these queue home

353
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,959
handmade things that you can't get

354
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,579
anywhere else

355
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,019
and then I have musically which I don't

356
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:42,389
think I'm signed in on this yet because

357
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,800
I haven't been on in forever

358
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,089
I should probably log it but you guys

359
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,680
want me to post music please comment

360
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,600
down below I have the Groupon app which

361
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,100
I got really into for a while because

362
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,420
someone introduced me to it and I was

363
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,189
just like kind of obsessed with it it

364
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,930
just gives you deals on like things near

365
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:56,610
you and like see I bought earrings like

366
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,199
this so now that I know they're five

367
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,149
dollars I could get your ings like that

368
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,769
for five dollars instead of spending $60

369
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,470
and then I have the D pop app which I

370
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,329
use to sell my clothes sometime then I

371
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,430
have the reach app which is just an app

372
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,709
that I use to do campaigns with

373
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,290
different brands then I have this app

374
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:15,269
called fit the fat - I don't know why I

375
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,009
have this app I downloaded it one night

376
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,170
because I was really bored and basically

377
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,939
you work out with your friend but I have

378
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,889
not used it so I should probably delete

379
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:24,179
it because I haven't played it at all

380
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:25,679
and then I have the best fiends app in

381
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,569
this literally is not even a sponsor

382
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,490
like they're not sponsoring this video I

383
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:31,949
just genuinely love playing best fiends

384
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,329
I'm on level 144 and I know some of you

385
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,740
guys play it comment down below

386
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,360
what level you're on see if you any of

387
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,819
you guys are ahead of me then I have or

388
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,990
East which I never use because I just

389
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,059
think that there's post mates in this

390
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,679
store - so why use ubereats because it's

391
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,660
also very limited and what you can get

392
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,129
then I have superimposed which wow I

393
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,809
have not been on this app in a while

394
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:51,300
like it just allows you to edit on your

395
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:53,519
phone like I could edit this TV into

396
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,649
this obviously like you can go and mask

397
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,209
it and like all that stuff oh I like

398
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,529
mess it up completely but it's just a

399
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,329
cool editing app that I use every once

400
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,220
in a while I have a corns which is

401
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:04,379
actually a super cool app basically what

402
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,240
you do you invest spare change so you go

403
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,160
on it and you can pay like let's say you

404
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,350
just went got gas in your car and it was

405
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,029
like 10 dollars and 42 cents and then

406
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,170
whatever remaining amount they will use

407
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,819
that money and they'll put it in your a

408
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,230
Coors account and they'll invest it for

409
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,790
you in two different companies and you

410
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,170
can choose to invest it in like Google

411
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,519
or like stuff like that and it's just

412
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,740
like a really cool concept because you

413
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,360
make money back from

414
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,830
money that you don't even realize is

415
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,450
missing sometimes you don't realize like

416
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,670
the difference if it's eleven dollars or

417
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,790
ten dollars and 42 cents um and then I

418
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,890
have wag and I also have Rover right

419
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,350
directly below the wag and this is just

420
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,120
so Linus can go on walks and get

421
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,160
grooming all that stuff and that's the

422
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,780
same thing as Rover I have the GroupMe

423
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,090
app which is just a messaging app and

424
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,230
then I have the app 94% which was

425
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,940
actually introduced to me by a few

426
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,980
friends so you just guess like the most

427
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,630
popular things that could apply to what

428
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,370
they say I have this app called block

429
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,930
and it's a hexa puzzle game and you can

430
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,090
go into all these different levels there

431
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:56,960
are so many ads on this game let's see

432
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,180
I'll show you guys what the games

433
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,940
actually like I'm on level 66 of rainbow

434
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,740
a and you basically can like build all

435
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,120
these different puzzles and then I have

436
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,010
my messages app which I'm not going to

437
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
open because I think it'll like show

438
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,010
like please use of my messages I have

439
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,600
like credit card information and stuff

pretty much all that is on my phone but

453
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,310
also I have the iPhone 7 plus and I love

454
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,960
that it has a tooth cameras you can be

455
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,520

00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,110

464
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,390

465
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,100
apps in the apps that I do have they're

466
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,360

401,The Hard Lives of Britain's Synthetic Marijuana Addicts,t6pmc7Tpx4w,"Legal highs are set to be outlawed by the British government in response to a growing number of news reports about students overdosing on the synthetic drugs after using them recreationally. On the eve of the ban, VICE travelled to Manchester to meet some more vulnerable users who have become addicted to these over-the-counter substances and discovered that solving the problem won't be as simple as making legal highs illegal.

especially since there's no she's not

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,009
sure well let's put your weight to what

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,259
I wish I could go back to my book

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:20,480
because so what yeah spice is horrible

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:21,890
after the spice with I know kid who died

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,280
of it couldn't couldn't get his

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:38,570
heartbeat is beating too fast just one

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:41,210
shot down as the new government began

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,310
making moves to ban all legal highs we

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,530
headed to Manchester where synthetic

11
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,410
drugs like spice and other brands like

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,690
vertex Pandora and insane Joker are

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,340
freely available to buy from news agents

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,380
and places known as head shops

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,090
although manufacturers state on the

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,840
packets that they're not fit for human

17
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,000
consumption

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,800
legal highs are used by creational II

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,680
and they make the press when students

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,710
overdose on them most people thought it

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,030
was a recreational drug a party drug or

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,030
something that we could perhaps dip in

23
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,219
announcer but actually nobody really

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,770
knows what the made of part of what

25
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:16,249
structure they have in how they impacts

26
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,109
on the body

27
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:19,909
although students with the support

28
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,340
network tend to dip in and out of

29
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,439
synthetic drugs we wanted to meet a much

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,939
more vulnerable group of people who can

31
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,249
suffer from the effects of a real

32
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,469
dependency on legal highs all the

33
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:32,569
clients that are presenting here are

34
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:34,399
using spice it's affecting the mental

35
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,929
health it's affecting the physical

36
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,299
health and it's a massive massive

37
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,369
problem Manchester has more rough

38
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,829
sleepers than anywhere outside of London

39
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,679
cuts to council services have left the

40
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,630
city with 20% fewer emergency beds and

41
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,209
the worth five years ago and during that

42
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,979
time legal highs had become a crutch to

43
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:55,700
many of the people who now live on the

44
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:58,039
streets I use it myself

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,590
and I use it because it takes the pain

46
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,909
away you know it's legal what can I do

47
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,409
what can sit here now there could be 20

48
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:04,579
offices around the word guns and

49
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,830
everything as long as I pull up by the

50
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,020
spice out and start rolling there I

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,520
nothing that anybody can do all about a

52
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,560
weed out on the lobby on me like a carb

53
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,239
on it and how my people go about trying

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,830
to get hold of it once you can't go into

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,870
a shop and buy the scroll it's going to

56
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,540
be some next-level book there's already

57
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,280
Street dealers out there but you worried

58
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:27,440
though that it might start criminalizing

59
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,720
people yes yes I've seen some but you've

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,670
got a look at this drink it's bringing

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,440
heroin addicts I know a heroin addict if

62
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,060
it's a spice that now that take spice

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,450
like you used to take heroin every

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,150
single day the reader will know so that

65
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,700
heroin at a class A drug is and the

66
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,360
spice is bringing him off that what is

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,950
in this stuff it's amazing

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,450
the misuse of drugs are controlled

69
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,450
substances on the basis of their

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,080
structure the ban can avoid in weed is

71
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:59,239
THC synthetic cannabis like spice mimics

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,010
the effects of weed by replicating and

73
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,799
slightly altering the chemical that gets

74
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,080
people high legal high manufacturers

75
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,850
design cannaboids and constantly update

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,380
the composition of their products so

77
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,480
that they remain within the law but

78
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,730
these experiments can leave the user

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,410
smoking a legal version of weed that can

80
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,690
be a hundred times stronger one of the

81
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,370
few volunteer organizations that caters

82
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,070
to Manchester's homeless community is

83
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,570
live share a charity that looks after

84
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:38,570
young people seeking advice and

85
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:40,150
accommodation well just everywhere trust

86
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:45,400
me I've seen some kids in wheelchairs

87
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,810
and it's funny Airport Monty must die

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,700
pretty much most of our clients who use

89
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,620
the spice I think the main reason that

90
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,750
it's it's being used quite a lot is each

91
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,630
tea people that used to smoke cannabis

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,130
to spending ten pound on cannabis and

93
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,620
they're getting like two smokes out of

94
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,829
it the spending five pound on a gram of

95
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,329
spice and you know it's going a lot

96
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,100
further and it's a lot stronger as well

97
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,239
I believe what I've noticed when you

98
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,639
come to Manchester is the number of

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,049
rough sleepers yeah yeah most of our

100
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,420
clients now are homeless and rough

101
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:17,209
sleeping why is that well realistically

102
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,700
its budget cuts to various services or

103
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,530
whatever and homelessness has been

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,420
there's been a major one we need more

105
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,670
shelters and we need more hostels

106
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,800
lifeshare is the first point of contact

107
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,250
for people living on the streets and

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,180
currently sees over a hundred clients a

109
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:38,360
regular member of they're dropping

110
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:43,610
clinic is tich where do you sleep at

111
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:50,360
night it car park or port we see be

112
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:55,940
waiting for a hostel when was the last

113
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:59,480
time you had a sparse morning how are

114
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:05,810
you feeling right now like what kill

115
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:08,660
someone says what go back into change

116
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,120
reason it's wait he's a detox but that'd

117
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,050
be pointless

118
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,510
why would even point this going these

119
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,560
strange ways there's more spice in that

120
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,560
and what's out on the streets

121
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,910
man she combined again you look like

122
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,760
you're about to roll a spliff tit yeah

123
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:31,220
what was I fear on a split for smaller

124
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,270
that's about 40 splits right there no

125
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,710

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:40,030
I don't want it what I'm in pain I'm in

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:51,970
shooting pins up my spine he's in the

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:56,560
net and in me are harmful if swallowed

131
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,560
may cause respiratory irritation

132
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:09,379
she wants a glass of water - have you

133
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:11,659
ever seen any other drug like this this

134
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:13,909
is supposed to be legal but it's as a

135
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,869
censored deterioration that you'd expect

136
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:19,460
from crack cocaine and they're quickly

137
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:22,099
rapidly deteriorates in the Lance you

138
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:34,309
know toast over a few weeks of using it

139
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:36,229
I've gone from that to this vice seeing

140
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:38,419
young people backing that would have

141
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,300
never normally a beg before and they're

142
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,919
going back in for spice you know risking

143
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,119

not battling no it's the same

161
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,490
irritability that you would associate

162
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,259
with crack but you're actually sometimes

163
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,759
that I'm showing physical withdrawal

164
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,949
science as well which that you

165
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,960
dissociate with heroin

166
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,599
I mean some of these young people

167
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,939
described living on the heart palpitated

168
00:07:51,599 --> 00:08:01,159
I'm really really going really bastard

169
00:07:53,939 --> 00:08:01,159
they just will not take on boys you know

170
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:34,800
yeah bit anxious but not to be bothered

171
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,860
oh my fault I'm in to get off slice and

172
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,339
I'm not kind of away from this round

173
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,510
another at which the moment turns to

174
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,490
come at me and breathe around her

175
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:49,470
everybody well you need to get a spice

176
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,190
it's been in this situation on the

177
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,190
streets problem

178
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,860
tich do you see that you're way out of

179
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,270
spice and being surrounded by the spice

180
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:16,540
culture is by getting a secure

181
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:16,540
accommodation and a hostel yeah I know

182
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,110
what they may be talking they don't one

183
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,910
before meeting teacher hadn't realized

184
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,630
that legal highs like spies were

185
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,580
addictive

186
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,620
he'd only gone a few hours without

187
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,860
smoking it before showing signs of

188
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,860
withdrawal

189
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,190
yeah

190
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,550
that guy's about wasn't going on

191
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,589
I wanted to find out from someone whose

192
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:26,570
job it is to get people off drugs if the

193
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,610
legal status of a particular substance

194
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:32,240
had any impacts on whether people take

195
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,490
it or not there's a level of naivety

196
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,910
around thinking that by making legalized

197
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:40,580
illegal people will be less inclined to

198
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,980
to use them if somebody's already in a

199
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,260
situation of relative chaos in their

200
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,180
life in general it would be unlikely

201
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,610
that would see a significant impacting

202
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,790
people using them it's not necessarily

203
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,310
going to positively impact on the people

204
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,230
who are using it but it impacts on who's

205
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,380
in charge of the supply and where the

206
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,499
supplier comes from it's a public health

207
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,769
issue and

208
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:09,099
what we wouldn't want to see is for the

209
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,809
criminal aspects of that problem to be

210
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:15,239
prioritized over the public health

211
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:18,309
aspect I think all services providing

212
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:20,889
information support access for members

213
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,509
of the public we've had significant

214
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,889
financial courts I think over the last

215
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:26,499
five years and that's probably going to

216
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:31,709
continue so there'll be a 25% reduction

217
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:31,709
in the overall spend on drugs an outcome

218
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,910
at a city centre soup kitchen local

219
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:51,879
health workers are dealing with spice

220
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:53,079
casualties on a daily basis moving lots

221
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,689
of people about it they say you know

222
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,999
they've never seen a drug have as

223
00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:08,379
massive effects as legal highs do on

224
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:10,660
people we had no trading on it see when

225
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:16,059
we didn't train inequality now we're

226
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:18,699
starting out lowering something doesn't

227
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:27,040
sort of change people's intention to do

228
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:29,889
something now I can smell it now yeah

229
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,350
yeah yeah and its business it doesn't

230
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:39,819
smell like weed does it so much

231
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:43,329
chemically belated they all knock you

232
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:45,249
out and numb your senses to the elements

233
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,249
and stuff this is why for coming a

234
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:52,710
homeless phenomenon is because it if

235
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:55,320
enormous your senses and it makes a door

236
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:58,020
you know it makes the elements not

237
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,660
bother you later that night we went to

238
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,460
find hitch as we wandered the streets it

239
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,740
was hard to ignore the irony in the fact

240
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,170
that spice was to some degree a problem

241
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,370
of the government's own making and there

242
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,680
seemed to be a similarity between

243
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,720
hitches cycle of satisfying his own

244
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,180
addiction and the government's way of

245
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,280
handling drugs a sort of whack-a-mole

246
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,970
tactic that only serves as a temporary

247
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,130
solution as ministers debate the details

248
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,440
of the new psychoactive substances bill

249
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,540
while cutting addiction services and

250
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,520
housing support only time will tell

251
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,820
where the problem might pop up again in

252
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,820
the future

253
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:45,439

00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,761
- So we're going to talk about
our Christmas traditions.

18
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:28,001
- These are things that we do
every year at Christmas time.

19
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,400
- The most wonderful

20
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,753
- [Both] time of the year!

21
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,203
- Sam, it's the first of December.

22
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:37,432
- That means we can put up
the Christmas decorations.

23
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:38,931
- [Both] Whoop, whoop!

24
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,361
- That means we can open
our Advent calendars.

25
00:00:41,361 --> 00:00:42,752
- [Both] Whoop, whoop!

26
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,752
(lighthearted rock music)

27
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,501
(both laughing)

28
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,606
- This chocolate's nasty.

29
00:00:57,606 --> 00:01:02,606
(lighthearted rock music)

30
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:03,961
- So, the first thing we do

31
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:06,034
is decorate the inside of our house.

32
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,521
- Most people decorate the
outsides of their house.

33
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,921
- Most people just have
one tree, but we have two.

34
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:12,601
- Because we're twins
and we need one each.

35
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,441
No, we don't.

36
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,569
And we also have a normal tree,
that's very old and frail.

37
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:19,209
(both laughing)

38
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,161
- We threaten to chuck it out every year.

39
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,311
When we decorate the large room,

40
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:25,445
- [Both] We do get a bit
carried away sometimes.

41
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,041
But we love Christmas!

42
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,961
- It's great. No, seriously, it's awesome.

43
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:31,961
- Yeah, you have to come here.

44
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,141
- You're going to see in a second.

45
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,721
It's this red, gold, green,

46
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:38,160
Christmas trees, 50 million Santas.

47
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,680
- 50 million, there
actually are 50 million.

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,521
(lighthearted rock music)

49
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,521
Another tradition that we do every year,

50
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,601
is that we go shopping
for a new decoration.

51
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,681
This year, we thought,
we're going to get something

52
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,391
a bit different.

53
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,551
- [Sam] Yes, you'll
never guess what we got.

54
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:08,161
This thing definitely stood out to us.

55
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,405
Teagan ran straight into it.

56
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,521
(children cheering)

57
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:17,521
(lighthearted rock music)

58
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:20,834
Here he is.

59
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,281
Everybody meet--

60
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:24,160
- Raffey, Gee-raff.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,160
(lighthearted rock music)

62
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,082
- Another thing we do every year--

63
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,641
- Is go and look at Christmas
lights on Christmas Eve.

64
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:52,560
(festive holiday music)

65
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,401
What do you guys do on Christmas Eve?

66
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:04,302
- Comment down below,
we would love to know.

67
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:06,282
- We hope you guys enjoyed this video.

68
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:07,034
Remember to watch

69
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,491
Jordan and Tyler's awesome
video from yesterday.

70
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,601
- Tune in tomorrow for
Frankie and Izzy's video.

71
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:14,246

74
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:19,080
- See you next time on Squared!

75
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,161
- [Both] See ya!

76
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,487
- That's a wrap!

77
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,201
(both laughing)

78
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,121
- We do get carried away sometimes, but--

79
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,001
- It's Christmas and we just love--

80
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,761
- You gotta go out there,
you know, it's Christmas.

81
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,601
One time in the year, just one.

82
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:34,801
- Love Christmas!

83
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,121
- Love Christmas!

84
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:37,641
Ho, ho, ho!

85
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,636
You walk in here like, ""Whoa,
it's Christmas in here.""

it is currently Wednesday October 19 403

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,829
p.m.

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,410
I just got ready I'm about to film a Q&A

23
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,050
for my main channel so it might actually

24
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,149
be up already if it is I'll link it down

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,650
in the description my makeup is kind of

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,200
dirt today I don't know if I'm feeling

27
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,710
it to be honest I might I might change

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,130
up the lips but I figured out you naked

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,780
like a normal Q&A like talking sit down

30
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,810
today with you guys and I feel like I

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,360
might be losing in my main channel like

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,220
relationship with my viewers like with

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,290
you guys like of course we're super

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,729
strong and you guys know what's going on

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,320
in my life but I feel like with my main

36
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,360
channel it's kind of not like that and I

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,490
want it to be like that again so I'm

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,840
gonna do a QA e even though I probably

39
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,189
won't get that many views and it won't

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
be as successful so I mean channel

41
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,540
videos my other main channel videos but

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,850
I think it's important for you guys to

43
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,860
get to know me and for us to develop a

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,350
better relationship you know some things

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,210
that I stopped logging yesterday but

46
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,619
Alicia and I went to the gym separately

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,590
oh wait I don't remember what the last

48
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,869
thing I've logged was but so far Monday

49
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,250
and Tuesday Jim went very well it is now

50
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,840
Wednesday I'm going to go to the gym

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,520
with Remy tonight and hopefully Alicia

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,649
too because this tour it makes it a

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,899
little difficult to work out on the

54
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,700
weekends so I'm going to try to do at

55
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,220
least Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,899
and four times a week I feel like is

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,390
really good I'm starting to see results

58
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,500
I tweeted out the other day and I

59
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,390
know if you guys thought I was serious

60
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,840
but I'm totally serious I've only lost

61
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,209
weight in my boobs like what my main

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,830
goal is not to lose weight because you

63
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,260
know like muscle weighs more than fat

64
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,900
balls the bla but I do have some extra

65
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,530
little chunk clunk on me I guess I do

66
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,680
want to lose weight or at least fat

67
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,330
weight so I've lost about seven pounds

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,980
now obviously a lot of that is water

69
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,080
weight so you know I've probably only

70
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,520
lost like two or so but two is still

71
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,890
progress but I feel like I've only lost

72
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,480
two pounds all in the boobs so that's a

73
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,250
struggle but I'm gonna keep working out

74
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,540
because you know you can't let that

75
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,489
bring it down itty bitty titty committee

76
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,830
so on top of me filming and editing

77
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,300
today I have to clean my entire

78
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,489
apartment because it's been a wreck no

79
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,690
offense and not blaming this on Alisha

80
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,390
or anything like that

81
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,340
anytime she hangs out over here I like

82
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,019
become the messiest person ever and I

83
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,500
feel like we both become messy people in

84
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:11,690
my apartment turns into a wreck so I

85
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,459
need a clean entire apartment pack for

86
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,900
tour and hopefully I'm gonna try and

87
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,000
book a flight up to Seattle in the

88
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,049
morning having booked it yet but I want

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,489
to make sure I get everything done

90
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:23,180
before booking X I don't want to like

91
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,950
not be ready to go so it's gonna be you

92
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,720
know it's gonna be a lot C I'm gonna try

93
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,060
to go early so I can hang out with Andy

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,130
at least for a day or a night and then

95
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,900
have my show this Saturday yeah it

96
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,510
should be fun and then afterwards after

97
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,030
my San Fran show and he's actually gonna

98
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,579
be coming here with AJ and they're gonna

99
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,110
be visiting me for like a week or so so

100
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,730
it's gonna be really fun so here's my

101
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,519
setup I usually have the curtains open

102
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,680
right now but but lighting is super

103
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,530
harsh and it's gonna bring in really bad

104
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,870
light so can't do that it's gonna be

105
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,420
hard to work with so this is my third

106
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,190
outfit change for this video this entire

107
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,230
outfit is from forever 21 by the way

108
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,090
literally had to tell like this is

109
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,070

118
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:51,270

119
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,270
big black a cameo right there the Hmong

120
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,980
stad which is very very popular and I

121
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,230
feel like every single person has it I

122
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,910
finally sold it actually just sold it on

123
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,900
Craigslist and the guy lived in my

124
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,360
apartment structure which was so

125
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,010
convenient I'm a but I sold it and I

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,600
feel like that was the one thing that

127
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,330
like made my room not very put together

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,730
as well as this crate which I'm actually

129
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,790
going to give to my friend Sarah who has

130
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:17,640
like a dog cafe kind of deal

131
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,080
so I shall donate that to her Ben's my

132
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
room will be pretty much together I

133
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,160
still want to get a brand new bed and

134
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,570
get like a new headboard and decorate it

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,220
I still need a you know decorate this

136
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,560
whole apartment I mean this whole room

137
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,479
but for the most part it's really

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,340
together and I'm happy now this whole

139
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,990
area is like super plain though this

140
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,810
that's why I kind of want like a bigger

141
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,760
headboard and like some string lights

142
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,590

the ABCs of lgbtq+ these are videos

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
where I read portions of my book because

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,519
I think it's interesting and makes good

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,039
content

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,740
my favorite content actually pronouns

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,960
are words used to refer to nouns when

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,309
not specifically using a nouns proper

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,559
name and this time we're going to talk

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,899
about and raw sexuality gyda sexuality

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,850
my sexuality and Wilma sexuality and

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:47,670
today the term / identity we're going to

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:49,559
unpack is gender confusion before we

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,329
dive into hella cool queer things though

16
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,940

17
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,370

talked about best fiends before because

20
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm obsessed for those of you unfamiliar

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,409
best fiends is a free puzzle adventure

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,090
game where you collect and upgrade

23
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,000
characters by matching same colored

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,640
objects and in doing so you defeat icky

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,590
grimy gross slugs ones even grosser than

26
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,200
those found in the upside down and this

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,240
month the game is turning into a holiday

28
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,450
wonderland and there will be some super

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,060
ooh I am currently on level 80 but I'm

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,189
salty about it because I was like over

32
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,950
level 200 until I accidentally deleted

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,640
the app and lost on my progress so that

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,740
was a bummer

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,390
and another thing that's rad about the

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,920
game now is you can connect through

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,659

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,369
the description and now back to gay

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,250
stuff today we're going to be talking

46
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,770
about just a couple not sis gender

47
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,780
identities super fun fact if you didn't

48
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,119
know there are lots of ways to not be

49
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,119
sis too often the media portrays not

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,429
idean so

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,310
with your gender assigned at birth in

52
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,800
just one way as being trapped in the

53
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,080
wrong body as being binary trans as

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,720
wanting to medically transition in every

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,150
way possible that is not always the case

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,970
though there are so many ways to not be

57
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,860
cysts and today two very special not sis

58
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,379
guests are going to tell you about how

59
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,599
they experience and express their gender

60
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:32,980
first there's KB who's non-binary for

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,160
those of you who haven't heard of this

62
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,310
identity before a non-binary is both a

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,489
specific identity and an umbrella term

64
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,069
for genders outside the gender binary a

65
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,519
non-binary person could be neither man

66
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,140
nor woman multiple genders

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,780
simultaneously flowing between genders

68
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,900
or something entirely different

69
00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,340
it's just not exclusively solely the

70
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,739
binary it's not just man or just woman

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,510
now being non-binary can be a totally

72
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:07,000
different experience for different

73
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,560
people who identify that way but this is

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,359
how KB describes the experience for them

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,400
[Music]

76
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:18,630
when I grew up there were no words for

77
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,410
non-binary identities you were one thing

78
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:25,569
boy or girl and anything in between that

79
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,230
was just a personal trait that you had

80
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:32,319
like how tomboys were boyish and boys

81
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,510
could be girlish and honestly for most

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,519
of my life I identified with my birth

83
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,260
assignment non-binary for me is

84
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,680
something that I personally had to

85
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,900
discover it wasn't put on a plate for me

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,870
to eat and it wasn't an answer to a very

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,359
hard question non-binary is more of an

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,819
extension of Who I am it doesn't define

89
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:55,280
my interactions my feelings or what

90
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:58,549
I do on Sundays it's just the feeling

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,909
like how when I finally got glasses I

92
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:05,150
discovered that the stars flicker and

93
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:07,489
the moon had shadows these things that

94
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,769
had been there this whole time and I

95
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,920
just discovered them

96
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,349
I consider non-binary to be less of an

97
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,769
expression of genders and more of an

98
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:21,859
explanation of them I kept searching for

99
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:24,770
something that made me feel like myself

100
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:26,720
I was never just one thing and now that

101
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,020
I can identify with something that can

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,009
regard multiple identities by gender a

103
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,139
gender etc I now have a word that I can

104
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:39,229
help people understand that I'm not just

105
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:42,320
a box with a checkmark inside the one

106
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:44,240
that matches my genitals mind if I would

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,580
non-binary but I'm sure I haven't

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,490
figured out everything about it and

109
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,340
that's okay after all I still go by my

110
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,560
birth pronouns and I still use my

111
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,190
assigned gender the only difference now

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,229
is I have a word for Who I am and for me

113
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:04,190
personally non-binary is a word that

114
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:09,710
helps me understand me just a little bit

115
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:12,440
more now grace my wife that's so fun to

116
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,110
say wife is a bit different race IDs as

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,419
grey gender and grey gender is an

118
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,580
identity that involves having a weak

119
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,490
sense of gender or being somewhat

120
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,259
apathetic about one's gender identity

121
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,789
and/or gender expression

122
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:30,860
etc being men about gender things while

123
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:32,870
grey gender people often do feel they

124
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,060
have a gender they may also feel

125
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,430
disconnected from their gender not

126
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,800
overly involved in gender as a concept

127
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,530
not particularly invested in their

128
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,320
gender that their gender is very

129
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,540
intermittent

130
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,180
maybe it comes and goes or that their

131
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,220
gender is just difficult to define now

132
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,860
unlike KB grace didn't write a blurb

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,600
about her gender for my book but he or

134
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
she is being caught off guard while I

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,100
asked her about it

136
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,480
[Music]

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,670
grace mm-hmm

138
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,760
what does being great gender mean to you

139
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:10,710
in a semi concise way bah bah

140
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:13,500
um you can do it to me I guess it means

141
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,440
that I don't have the greatest grasp on

142
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,120
my gender or in that I sometimes don't

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,530
really just care about it too much

144
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,140
I'm kind of an ambivalent to it my I

145
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:33,090
guess a big part for me personally is

146
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:35,940
that my you know um my part they just

147
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,510
don't play a huge role in my gender okay

148
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,730
cool

149
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,890
yeah I think that's right that makes

150
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,890
sense yeah I love you I love you too

151
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,970
Thank You grace and KB I invite all

152
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,980
these guests by the way in an attempt

153
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,710
for these genders and these identities

154
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,840
to become more real and more humanized

155
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,330
for you guys I want you to understand

156
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,930
they're not just definitions that exist

157
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,420
somewhere in a book or on tumblr but in

158
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,630
fact there are real people behind them

159
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,790
there are humans who feel this way and

160
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,830
claim these identities so to wrap things

161
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,290
up there is more than one way to not be

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:15,750
sis and in the end people should do and

163
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,880
claim whatever identity affirms their

164
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,100
gender and makes them comfortable if you

165
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,550
liked this content a lot of it was

166
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:47,629
verbatim from my book so

411,DIY Heart Friendship Bracelets,pfjfikSEVM8,"This Friendship bracelet tutorial shows how to DIY heart friendship bracelets. These DIY bracelets are really easy, simple, but cute and I show how to make them step by step, slowly for beginners. To make one of these cute heart bracelets you need embroidery floss, string or a thread and a cute button. We will make an awesome DIY button ending to this heart friendship bracelet, which will allow us to take the bracelet on and off our wrist without damaging it. You can use any color you would like to make these bracelets to match your outfit, so these bracelets are always fashionable. You can wear these DIY heart friendship bracelets alone or you can pair them with other bracelet jewelry. They go great with either gold or silver bracelets. These bracelets are a great gift and perfect for Valentines Day! If you use darker colors perhaps these bracelets can be worn by men (your boyfriend) or you can make it for your best friend. I have made three heart bracelets just for me!

http://sarabeautycorner.com/

We need four pieces of string for this heart friendship bracelet DIY. We pull strings together, make a knot in the middle of the bracelet and tape strings to a flat surface. Then we start to knot and to make a heart friendship bracelet we need to know how to make two different knotting rows -- a normal and a special friendship bracelet rows. For that, we need to learn how to make two knots -- a forward and a backward knot. Then we just continue with rows, two special and two normal until the heart friendship bracelet is long enough to fit around our wrist. This is all there is to this easy for beginners friendship bracelet DIY.

In this friendship bracelet tutorial I show how to make a heart pattern. If you would like me to make other friendship bracelet patterns, like a chevron friendship bracelet, let me know in the comments and I may do another bracelet DIY. It will be just as easy, perfect for bracelet making beginners.

00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,320
you how to make an adorable heart

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,650
friendship bracelet

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,699
you only need some thread and a button

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,560
seriously yeah let's do this to make our

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,350
heart friendship bracelet we need some

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
embroidery floss tape a needle which is

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,030
handy if you make a mistake with the

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,010
knot and scissors choose two colors of

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,930
the embroidery floss and also take a

15
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,390
small button for an awesome closure to

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,300
the bracelet cut two strands of each

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,699
color approximately 50 inches or 1.2

18
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,980
meters long put the four strands

19
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,820
together fold them in half and then make

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,820
a knot like this

21
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:02,120
take the notes onto a flat surface and

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,859
divide the threads into two sets you

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,590
need to have two threads of each color

24
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:08,270
on each side color should alternate and

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,610
you must have a mirror image with the

26
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,290
left and the right set of threads the

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,330
outside thread color will be the color

28
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,250
of the hearts for me it's yellow and the

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,840
red will be the background now let's

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,729
first see how the heart will look like

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,310
and how to achieve the pattern each

32
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,320
heart consists of four rows two special

33
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,570
rows for the upper half of the heart and

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,549
two normal Chevron rows for the bottom

35
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,759
part then it just continued the same

36
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,920
steps to special to normal to special to

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,080
normal and so on until your bracelet is

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,909
long enough I'm going to start with two

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,250
normal rows just because it's easier to

40
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,429
first learn the basics start on the left

41
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,409
side with the outermost strand make a

42
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:47,780
forward knot by creating a four shape

43
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,670
over the second outermost strand go

44
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,610
under that strand and back out through

45
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,399
the loop pull the thread to tighten make

46
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,500
sure you always not twice continue

47
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,420
making forward knots over the remaining

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,439
two strands until the working strand

49
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,439
reaches the middle

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,250
on the right side will be making

51
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,020
backward knots so let's quickly see the

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,210
difference between a forward and a

53
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,950
backward knot for the forward knot you

54
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,360
have the working strand on the left and

55
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,730
your nodding over the Strand on the

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,860
right with the working strand you make a

57
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,080
four shape over the Strand beside on the

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,090
right like this take the end of your

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,070
working strand loop it under the red

60
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,470
strand and back out through the opening

61
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,450
remember to not twice before moving to

62
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,250
the following strand when making a

63
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,960
backward knot you have a working strand

64
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,940
on the right and you're nodding over the

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,030
Strand on the left make a reverse four

66
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,860
shape like this loop the working strand

67
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,580
under the red one and back through the

68
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,650
opening

69
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,420
now that forward and backward knots are

70
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,520
clear let's continue with the bracelet

71
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm taking the outermost strand on the

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,450
right which will be my working strand

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,310
for this half of the Chevron row make a

74
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,800
reverse four shape over the second

75
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,510
outermost strand loop the yellow working

76
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,180
strand under the red one and through the

77
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:13,010
opening and of course don't forget to

78
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,840
always not twice continue making

79
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,550
backward knots over the remaining two

80
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,350
strands towards the left until the

81
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,710
yellow working strand has reached the

82
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,710
middle

83
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,870
make two backward knots with the middle

84
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,870
yellow strands to connect the two house

85
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,219
our first normal row is finished we need

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,980
to make another row in the exactly the

87
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,959
same way since now our outermost strands

88
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,390
are red we will get a red Chevron row

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,280
instead of a yellow make two forward

90
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,140
knots over each of the three strands of

91
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,489
the left set until the working strand

92
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,920
reaches the middle now go to the right

93
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,049
set of strands take the outermost strand

94
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,700
and make two backward knots over each of

95
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,090
the three strands until the outermost

96
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,829
working strand reaches the middle make

97
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,769
two final backward knots with the two

98
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:19,049
middle strands to connect the two halves

99
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:21,599
now we finish the second normal row it's

100
00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:23,759
time for the first special row again

101
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,770
start on the left side take the second

102
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,990
outermost strand mine is red and make a

103
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,880
backward knot over the outermost strand

104
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:38,880
which is yellow in my case not twice and

105
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,770
leave the red strand on the Left take

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,900
the second outermost strand which is now

107
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,759
yellow and make forward knots over the

108
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,530
remaining two strands of the left set

109
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,919
until the yellow strand reaches the

110
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,919
middle

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,540
now go to the right side of strands take

112
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,460
the second outermost strand - red and

113
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:08,620
make a forward knot over the outermost

114
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,620
strand which is yellow in my case not

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,419
twice and leave the red strand on the

116
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,950
right

117
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,750
take the second outermost strand which

118
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,610
is now yellow and make backward knots

119
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,470
over the remaining two strands of the

120
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,460
right set until the yellow strand

121
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,460
reaches the middle

122
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,349
make two final backward knots with the

123
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:44,139
two yellow middle strands to connect the

124
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:46,539
two halves we have finished our first

125
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,479
fashion row now it's time for the second

126
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,259
special row so let's repeat the steps

127
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,090
start on the left

128
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,979
take the second outermost strand and

129
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,479
make a backward knot over the outermost

130
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,479
strand not twice

131
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,770
take the second outermost strand and

132
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,719
make forward knots over the remaining

133
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:12,490
two strands until the second outermost

134
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:15,069
strand reaches the middle now go to the

135
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,840
right set of strands take the second

136
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:24,280
outermost strand and make a forward knot

137
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:25,930
over the outermost strand not twice take

138
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,789
the second outermost strand and make

139
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,469
backward knots over the remaining two

140
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:37,000
strands of the right set until it

141
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:38,919
reaches the middle make two final

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,919
backward knots with the two red middle

143
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,199
strands to connect the two halves and we

144
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,120
finished our second special row as you

145
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,219
can see the two special rows represent

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,229
the upper half of the heart now we need

147
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,560
to again make a normal row to finish the

148
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:52,629
heart

149
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,610
so take the outermost strand and make

150
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:56,729
forward knots over the three strands of

151
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,199
the left set until it reaches the middle

152
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,029
now take the outermost strand on the

153
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,889
right and make backward knots over the

154
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,550
three strands of the right set until it

155
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,550
reaches the middle

156
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,370
connect the to house by making backward

157
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,160
knots with the middle yellow strands

158
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,800
next make a second normal row then the

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,450
special rows again and so on so just

160
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,340
keep repeating the two normal in two

161
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,740
special rows until your bracelet is long

162
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,420
enough to fit your wrist I loved making

163
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,640
friendship bracelets when I was younger

164
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,800
but back then I only knew how to make

165
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,540
the standard regional lines pattern I

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,730
was so happy when I learned how to make

167
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,680
this hard one it is actually super easy

168
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,200
to make and it only takes about three

169
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,030
hours to finish it when the bracelet is

170
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,310
long enough make a simple knot at the

171
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,020
end to secure your work now I'll show

172
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,760
you how to make a button closure which

173
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,010
allows taking the bracelet on and off

174
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,780
your wrist easily without damaging it

175
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,010
choose one strand of the embroidery

176
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,390
floss and thread the button on like so

177
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,950
make two to three knots to secure the

178
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:01,000
button as close to the ending of the

179
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:02,380
bracelet as possible cut the excess

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,480
thread and you're finished

181
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,190
now you have this lovely closure to your

182
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,650
bracelet there isn't just extremely

183
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,660

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash) talk on their cell phones while walking down the hall; Cher tells about her mother.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Jane Austen might never have imagined that her 1816 novel Emma could be turned into a fresh and satirical look at ultra-rich teenagers in a Beverly Hills high school. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash), both named after ""great singers of the past that now do infomercials,"" are pampered upper-class girls who care less about getting good grades than wearing the right clothes and being as popular as possible. But Cher, who lives with her tough yet warm-hearted lawyer dad (Dan Hedaya) and hunky, sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd), also has an innate urge to help those less fortunate -- like the two introverted teachers she brings together (""negotiating"" herself improved grades in the process) and new friend Tai (Brittany Murphy), who starts out a geek and ends up a Cher prodigy. Cher also possesses her own sensitive side, and she is looking for the perfect boyfriend, whom she ends up finding where she least expected.

Fun fact: I just sent Rose to get my half a subway I have left downstairs and she's really angry that I've been whining at her to go and get it for like an hour but she still went and got it like the little bitch she is 😏😏😏","1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,009
I've got burger juice on my bare foot

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:09,660
that's disgusting

Rose today we're going to be talking

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,199
about our relationship we're actually

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,189
married but we're just going to be

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,640
talking about our relationship in

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,300
general

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,500
how's YouTube affected our relationship

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,390
and I think it's quite interesting well

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,429
because as people know that some of the

14
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,650
lesbian youtubers have broken up swore

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,270
they were lost to that couple who I

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,980
think I've called boy versus girl who

17
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,899
quite famously boat ramp and said oh

18
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,670
it's the pressure of vlogging I checked

19
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,149
out that channel and they're back

20
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,640
together

21
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,170
yay rocking every day right tell me

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,329
about it I don't do it personally I

23
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,860
think that number one it's quite its

24
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,690
weight rusev and sense yeah you're

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,399
letting people like see your life or

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,110
sharing everything your journey to speak

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,730
with your audience which is lovely but

28
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,489
also if you're not turned off of camera

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,070
to have sex well it's one of the things

30
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,440
but also to just do you yeah not

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,809
everything needs to be everything needs

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,309
to be drafted first of all but shared it

33
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,780
needs to be a clear distinction Rosie

34
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,760
between what you decide to come on the

35
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,320
internet and also what you do in your

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
personal time now the good thing about

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,310
our channel is everything that we put

38
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,080
out there is genuinely conversations

39
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,270
that we'd normally have off-camera

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,009
yeah but I still even then that being

41
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,140
said I still don't want to have every

42
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,729
conversation that's natural on camera

43
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,740
because I feel like yeah those Sun

44
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,350
colonisation needs to be discussed on

45
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,900
camera great like your breath we're not

46
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,729
we were at VidCon on the LGBT panel we

47
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,380
were talking about boundaries what you

48
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,880
do and don't share by the way if you can

49
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,090
hear noise back when it's the dog eating

50
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,740
and we said we don't really have

51
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,229
boundaries of what we've shown you don't

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,479
we never said oh I will discuss this no

53
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,399
work discuss this we might get what

54
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,990
boundaries that doesn't mean to say that

55
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,850
I want to have every conversation with

56
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,920
you on camera I have the best friends

57
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,720
right if you see them every single day

58
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,230
you're gonna fall out you've got to

59
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,450
Elmore

60
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,290
each other you can't spend too much time

61
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,640
together

62
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,340
you know read somehow I should do

63
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,570
whatever but yeah but occasionally we

64
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,070
don't argue but you're going to get a

65
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,080
little bit pissy with someone it's you

66
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,260
know every day and in that sense I think

67
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,900
the daily vlogging it's like having an

68
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,590
audience with you all the time so then

69
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,630
you need a break

70
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,130
yeah one thing I will say is from doing

71
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,380
YouTube we have built up obviously an

72
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,390
audience and then they the audience you

73
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,820
guys come across in your letter to

74
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,850
tumblr Instagram for any annoying one

75
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,100
thing that has changed is that I still

76
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,370
not care about what I tweeted I don't

77
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,050
really care too much now but it's very

78
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,970
different tweeting something and a few

79
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,400
of your friends were playing yeah I then

80
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,280
tweeting so to an audience and it's

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,890
quite overwhelming added so many

82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,870
different alters yeah unlike I don't

83
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,700
know I guess yeah you can't be as

84
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,410
homophobic as you like and then it's

85
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,790
quite overwhelming to read all these

86
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,210
different opinions and then it makes you

87
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,440
think what's my opinion now because so

88
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,410
many of you are said all different

89
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,930
things and do you think it's like we

90
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,060
have your personality because so many

91
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,330
people say different things about you

92
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,370
into your little my personality can't be

93
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,750
touched but in terms of perfecting our

94
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,070
relationship I think that sometimes in

95
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,620
arguing with someone on Twitter which is

96
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,300
ragged anthems yeah then maybe I'll be

97
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,709
like really angry maybe we might have a

98
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,840
very good day because I'll be yeah

99
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,730
another thing that I think is difficult

100
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,220
being on the Internet is because we're

101
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,890
two women in a relationship I think we

102
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,840
got get compared to against each other

103
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,730
but pitted against each other when it's

104
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,340
not really a comparison right where is

105
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,930
it no not us I feel like if we're a man

106
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,690
and a woman that wouldn't happen

107
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,540
yeah and for some reason I've never been

108
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:44,760
up to fathom why Clapham yeah perfect

109
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,750
person fathom having found the lovin use

110
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,080
it's awesome

111
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,510
baby you sit back over what the fuck is

112
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,830
fathom fathom

113
00:03:51,510 --> 00:04:00,099
fathom what could it change icon I say

114
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,319
fun what do you say fun mate I did not

115
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,150
that's got my Mary's yeah you don't

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,620
women are more than looks we've we've

117
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,970
come a long way since like the forties

118
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,250
when we were just like pretty housewives

119
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,110
who baked so it's like why in this day

120
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,670
and age when we're trying to be educated

121
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,170
we're trying to get a quality you know

122
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,389
we're trying to like you know really

123
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,699
change the world so then it's like why

124
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,340
you like that one's prettier it's like

125
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,410
oh my god men more than looks like

126
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,039
you're you don't want men to judge your

127
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,199
look we I love them truth also what I

128
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,729
can sit here and troll this conversation

129
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,530
because I naturally like to do that yeah

130
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,000
it's like I've got a point

131
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,530
yeah just because we're together a

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
mere-- safest couple and we're both

133
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,880
absolutely it's don't happen it doesn't

134
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,800
mean that we need to be compared to each

135
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,870
other yeah it causes stress and

136
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,960
pressures on my relationship not I think

137
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,639
we're lucky that with somehow not too

138
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,110
sensitive to that because I guess it

139
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,599
depends on personality so I think that

140
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,740
could be a real well I think that if you

141
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:56,050
gonna put yourself on the internet

142
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,210
whether it's alone or as a couple you've

143
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,400
got to have a slightly thicker skin than

144
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,259
anybody else and over the years I felt

145
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,370
quite thick skin yeah like a clinical

146
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,110
where are you to use your anything

147
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,090
burner in a way that you know it's like

148
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,410
one flip you say sigmax me a might gets

149
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,199
me a little bit but tomorrow I'm gonna

150
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:14,530
forget it yeah but it's harder when your

151
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,139
main competition is your wife yeah only

152
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,909
you create that yeah when I

153
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,289
accomplishment one of it we already won

154
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,150
here's something that annoys you about

155
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:24,280
being online uh pressure that may affect

156
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,229
us online bandwidth I definitely think

157
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,789
that if we were doing it every day there

158
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,560
is less time in the day you're right

159
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:30,760
just maybe it's not the audience maybe

160
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,260
it's not the rocking of day but maybe

161
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,479
speak women of having a long our

162
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,820
high-pressure job there could be a

163
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,349
problem if YouTube ever became unfun to

164
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,610
do because first of all you guys would

165
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,110
be able to tell from my videos that we

166
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,940
weren't enjoying it yeah I think that

167
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,700
would in itself put pressure on our

168
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,860
relationship

169
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,360
like we did yeah but we have to do it to

170
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,310
make money man

171
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,190
but that motion is is that such a word

172
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,890
as unfun of course there is zooming not

173
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,600
fun and fun if I don't get this we're

174
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,790
not hyphenated yeah it's an English word

175
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,100
it's it American merchants your son

176
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,350
either one and it's a word if it's not

177
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,870
hyphenated that means funds or word yeah

178
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,640
you're breaking rules try and trick me

179
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:11,060
I'm gonna English it's the only thing

180
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,520
I've got no content for them what's our

181
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,500
biggest YouTube related argument being

182
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,150
about don't you ever come on I'll tell

183
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,000
you one way in that YouTube mixes our

184
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:22,760
gear one this actually means to feel

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,030
great sometimes our gaming equipment

186
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,160
doesn't work one we're about to film a

187
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,080
rose gets really angry really quickly

188
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,930
about things like technology for God I

189
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,330
mean 1 to 100 I get it if roses mind

190
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,550
first like technology should work yeah

191
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,020
like yeah press a button down to an

192
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,300
approximate of like white it's just

193
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,370
simple technologies do it what it

194
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,680
doesn't and sometimes it like for some

195
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,750
reason our game capture software like I

196
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,290
dunno doesn't work yeah Rose gets really

197
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,240
irate for fuck's sake I you know you

198
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,220
don't know me and you're sort of taking

199
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,050
you have a technical related issue I

200
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,460
feel like because we got married for

201
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,940
like reasons we've been together for a

202
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,670
long time started YouTube before it was

203
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,830
a thing like whatever you think we're

204
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,940
trying to do you anything right so we're

205
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,500
20 YouTube things with internet

206
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,450
celebrities I've seen in a way that

207
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,430
manifested and it sucks that's our

208
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,080
destiny I'll see you a list now I just

209
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,250
feel like I just feel like because we

210
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,140
started YouTube for the right reasons

211
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,130
number one we started dating to the

212
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,230
right reasons number two

213
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,030
nothing is fake because I feel like it's

214
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,150
something is fake or maybe even just

215
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,040
exaggerated or stage yeah that is just

216
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,960
an early grave in terms of relationship

217
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,520
and curry up it's plentiful good ads and

218
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm not saying we can't act I would love

219
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,660
to do so expected but everything is

220
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,040
genuine anything that's like

221
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,780
disingenuous and

222
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,270
venting I feel like have a very limited

223
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,860
shelf life yeah so so long you can fake

224
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,050
it but now I mean we're not making

225
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:50,350
anything anything we're faking is fact

226
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,350
that we're sisters but yeah that's weird

227
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,510
this one we've got on camera because you

228
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,980
can slap me I'm gonna laugh about it

229
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,750
you should make make a relationship

230
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,600
stronger or our relationship might just

231
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,160
grow naturally blossomed and then as we

232
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,380
were doing that we were also youtubing

233
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,420
from day once that's grown so maybe

234
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,740
we're just it has the better a ship

235
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,810
because it wasn't like we're in a ratio

236
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,420
and then suddenly returned the cameras

237
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,010
on our lives is that Haley hope we've

238
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,330
actually and it's it was good or because

239
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,430
when our relationship was small and

240
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,160
growing and developing our audience was

241
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,420
small I'm growing in developing and you

242
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,310
know now I'm married and we have a

243
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,380
bigger audience but it's like you know

244
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,610
we obviously married because we can cope

245
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,229
of our relationship the ups and downs

246
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,490
that's why we got married you know we're

247
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:36,729
out for the long haul guys we're just

248
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,340
like you you know they're human beings

249
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:42,290
so what we look for we exactly we're not

250
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,570
for meat we dress better but I just want

251
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:47,090
to say that you know we have our bad

252
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,830
days to know how much of that can I

253
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,740
blame on YouTube probably none of it

254
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,150
yeah you know because we go through

255
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,830
normal human being

256
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,720
type video we're gonna talk about as we

257
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,120
can't go through life like I'm a

258
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
positive person I can't be happy 24/7 I

259
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,020
that's so unrealistic so we do have

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,500
negative emotions just like lotion and

261
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,390
goop

262
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,860
so we're very rigid less on you because

263
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,440
we have a great job well the money makes

264
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,720
it easy yeah we feel bad

265
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,240
will this go blow if you pass yeah no

266
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,130
and you fly color when you feel bad

267
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,740
near you can't make it rain opponents

268
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,030
yeah

269
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,470
you know what really annoys me when you

270
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,480
have a go at me for making the barrier

271
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,640
between us and baby very folks with

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,200
barrier I don't need to do but I'm comfy

273
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,060
if I make the barrier then I'd roll on I

274
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,370
have to have one leg in one leg out I'm

275
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,370
just not gonna go oh yeah I mean it's

276
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,340
not barrier it's just my comfort

277
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,790
procedure and you take it so personally

278
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,220
I mean between us when I marry touch me

279
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,380
touch me even open 230 degrees outside

280
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,660
you're hot sweaty naked bodies online am

281
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,440
i dying yeah but the question is how I

282
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:52,870
really genuinely about this right now

283
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,340
mate not exactly okay something I need

284
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,650
to talk about in this video is the fact

285
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,300
that a lot of comments has said over you

286
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,840
know kiss Rosie as much anymore videos

287
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,730
let me tell you I so I went through this

288
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,660
phase of really worrying that anything

289
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,250
overly sexual was going to drive views

290
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,860
and traffic to the channel but I didn't

291
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,690
want views and like because I did I

292
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,140
didn't want it for those reasons so I

293
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,880
actively stopped kissing Rosie for

294
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,410
several months even though even though

295
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,970
you would naturally kiss me we will

296
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,440
never I think because it's sports were

297
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,540
actually I used to like sometimes you

298
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,680
like punked me and shit on camera but

299
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,540
you were like look I don't wanna get

300
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,190
abused are you trying to be entertaining

301
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,510
though I went through the space of

302
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,070
worrying that every time I'd actually

303
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,490
kiss Rosie which was completely genuine

304
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,710
people for these days as fake or like

305
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,280
clickbait anything like that which I can

306
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,830
understand

307
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,160
so then I made you realize that actually

308
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:49,000
the most unnatural thing the most fake

309
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,220
thing is to not kiss me when I wanted to

310
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,780
it's not kiss yep so I was like look if

311
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,200
you want to kiss me kiss me if you don't

312
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,480
don't

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,000
but don't like actually not me not

314
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,370
watching you i right it's just as bad as

315
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,410
kissing me just for views that both just

316
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,970
is that just being natural and Rohde you

317
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,170
like yeah that's what we're about

318
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,630
so now I don't really give a shit

319
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,270
because I just think okay if I kiss

320
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,970
right

321
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,620
I don't I don't I used like a slightly

322
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,360
kissy thumbnail so what we build in the

323
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,360
video have you not coming up bait by

324
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,860
just the video thumbnail that's exactly

325
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,210
what it said in the tin so that's why I

326
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,500
think it's really for a while but now

327
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,420
the back's been completely genuine

328
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,760
because I thought what better thing to

329
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,680
do to promote a genuine relationship

330
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
than to be genuine yeah it's raising

331
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,530
whatever Michael Rizzi

332
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,600
let's know I'm sure it is this is our

333
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,040
natural relationship so yeah it did

334
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,390
affect my relationship for a while me

335
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,580
being very very sensitive about what

336
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,370
might drive use what might not but now

337
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,240
who cares we're just gonna keep doing us

338
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,860
and there you go

339
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,660
so all guys I'd already feel like

340
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,950
YouTube has negatively affected our

341
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,810
relationship anything it makes it

342
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,100
stronger it's good because we started at

343
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,510
the right time you guys have grown up

344
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,850
with our relationships everything you

345
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,470
see it's been defense can real and I

346
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,620
feel like you guys actually give us

347
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,180
strength to pull through a issue that we

348
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,660
might have because you guys ship it so

349
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,670
much and it makes me shit myself so the

350
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,620
moral of the story is I don't YouTube's

351
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,350
affected our relationship in any way I

352
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,850
think we are not oversensitive and if

353
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,680
anything comes our way that we get

354
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,050
posted maybe its effect that's

355
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,940
positively yeah like I subscribe see you

356
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,940
